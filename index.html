This exposure could happen if you have a Search Head cluster and you configure the Splunk Enterprise `SHCConfig` log channel at the DEBUG logging level in the clustered deployment. <br><br>The vulnerability would require either local access to the log files or administrative access to internal indexes, which by default only the admin role receives. Review roles and capabilities on your instance and restrict internal index access to administrator-level roles. <br><br>See [Define roles on the Splunk platform with capabilities](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/Rolesandcapabilities), [Deploy a search head cluster](https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/administer/distributed-search/9.4/deploy-search-head-clustering/deploy-a-search-head-cluster), [Deploy secure passwords across multiple servers](https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/administer/manage-users-and-security/9.4/install-splunk-enterprise-securely/deploy-secure-passwords-across-multiple-servers) and [Set a security key for the search head cluster](https://help.splunk.com/splunk-enterprise/administer/distributed-search/9.4/configure-search-head-clustering/set-a-security-key-for-the-search-head-cluster#id_2c54937a_736c_47b5_9485_67e9e390acfa__Set_a_security_key_for_the_search_head_cluster)  for more information.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 38 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent. Prior to 3.22.6, if the victim had "Write" auto-approved, an attacker with the ability to submit prompts to the agent could write to VS Code settings files and trigger code execution. There were multiple ways to achieve that. One example is with the php.validate.executablePath setting which lets you set the path for the php executable for syntax validation. The attacker could have written the path to an arbitrary command there and then created a php file to trigger it. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.22.6.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>WeGIA is a web manager for charitable institutions. The Wegia server has a vulnerability that allows excessively long HTTP GET requests to a specific URL. This issue arises from the lack of validation for the length of the errorstr parameter. Tests confirmed that the server processes URLs up to 8,142 characters, resulting in high resource consumption, elevated latency, timeouts, and read errors. This makes the server susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.  This vulnerability is fixed in 3.3.0.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32023
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 38 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. From 2.8 to before 8.0.3, 7.4.5, 7.2.10, and 6.2.19, an authenticated user may use a specially crafted string to trigger a stack/heap out of bounds write on hyperloglog operations, potentially leading to remote code execution. The bug likely affects all Redis versions with hyperloglog operations implemented. This vulnerability is fixed in 8.0.3, 7.4.5, 7.2.10, and 6.2.19. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing hyperloglog operations. This can be done using ACL to restrict HLL commands.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in the `ObsidianReader` class of the run-llama/llama_index repository, versions 0.12.23 to 0.12.28, allows for arbitrary file read through symbolic links. The `ObsidianReader` fails to resolve symlinks to their real paths and does not validate whether the resolved paths lie within the intended directory. This flaw enables attackers to place symlinks pointing to files outside the vault directory, which are then processed as valid Markdown files, potentially exposing sensitive information.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the huggingface/transformers repository, specifically in version 4.49.0. The vulnerability is due to inefficient regular expression complexity in the `SETTING_RE` variable within the `transformers/commands/chat.py` file. The regex contains repetition groups and non-optimized quantifiers, leading to exponential backtracking when processing 'almost matching' payloads. This can degrade application performance and potentially result in a denial-of-service (DoS) when handling specially crafted input strings. The issue is fixed in version 4.51.0.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The JSONReader in run-llama/llama_index versions 0.12.28 is vulnerable to a stack overflow due to uncontrolled recursive JSON parsing. This vulnerability allows attackers to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) by submitting deeply nested JSON structures, leading to a RecursionError and crashing applications. The root cause is the unsafe recursive traversal design and lack of depth validation, which makes the JSONReader susceptible to stack overflow when processing deeply nested JSON. This impacts the availability of services, making them unreliable and disrupting workflows. The issue is resolved in version 0.12.38.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6210
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in the ObsidianReader class of the run-llama/llama_index repository, specifically in version 0.12.27, allows for hardlink-based path traversal. This flaw permits attackers to bypass path restrictions and access sensitive system files, such as /etc/passwd, by exploiting hardlinks. The vulnerability arises from inadequate handling of hardlinks in the load_data() method, where the security checks fail to differentiate between real files and hardlinks. This issue is resolved in version 0.5.2.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6386
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The parisneo/lollms repository is affected by a timing attack vulnerability in the `authenticate_user` function within the `lollms_authentication.py` file. This vulnerability allows attackers to enumerate valid usernames and guess passwords incrementally by analyzing response time differences. The affected version is the latest, and the issue is resolved in version 20.1. The vulnerability arises from the use of Python's default string equality operator for password comparison, which compares characters sequentially and exits on the first mismatch, leading to variable response times based on the number of matching initial characters.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3108
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 6, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A critical deserialization vulnerability exists in the run-llama/llama_index library's JsonPickleSerializer component, affecting versions v0.12.27 through v0.12.40. This vulnerability allows remote code execution due to an insecure fallback to Python's pickle module. JsonPickleSerializer prioritizes deserialization using pickle.loads(), which can execute arbitrary code when processing untrusted data. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious payloads to achieve full system compromise. The root cause includes an insecure fallback mechanism, lack of validation or safeguards, misleading design, and violation of Python security guidelines.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38235
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 6, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 13 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: appletb-kbd: fix "appletb_backlight" backlight device reference counting

During appletb_kbd_probe, probe attempts to get the backlight device
by name. When this happens backlight_device_get_by_name looks for a
device in the backlight class which has name "appletb_backlight" and
upon finding a match it increments the reference count for the device
and returns it to the caller. However this reference is never released
leading to a reference leak.

Fix this by decrementing the backlight device reference count on removal
via put_device and on probe failure.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48952
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 22 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>NetAlertX is a network, presence scanner, and alert framework. Prior to version 25.6.7, a vulnerability in the authentication logic allows users to bypass password verification using SHA-256 magic hashes, due to loose comparison in PHP. In vulnerable versions of the application, a password comparison is performed using the `==` operator at line 40 in front/index.php. This introduces a security issue where specially crafted "magic hash" values that evaluate to true in a loose comparison can bypass authentication. Because of the use of `==` instead of the strict `===`, different strings that begin with 0e and are followed by only digits can be interpreted as scientific notation (i.e., zero) and treated as equal. This issue falls under the Login Bypass vulnerability class. Users with certain "weird" passwords that produce magic hashes are particularly affected. Services relying on this logic are at risk of unauthorized access. Version 25.6.7 fixes the vulnerability.

<strong>Description : </strong>In MbedTLS 3.3.0 before 3.6.4, mbedtls_lms_import_public_key does not check that the input buffer is at least 4 bytes before reading a 32-bit field, allowing a possible out-of-bounds read on truncated input. Specifically, an out-of-bounds read in mbedtls_lms_import_public_key allows context-dependent attackers to trigger a crash or limited adjacent-memory disclosure by supplying a truncated LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature) public-key buffer under four bytes. An LMS public key starts with a 4-byte type indicator. The function mbedtls_lms_import_public_key reads this type indicator before validating the size of its input.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-49600

<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 12 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In MbedTLS 3.3.0 before 3.6.4, mbedtls_lms_verify may accept invalid signatures if hash computation fails and internal errors go unchecked, enabling LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature) forgery in a fault scenario. Specifically, unchecked return values in mbedtls_lms_verify allow an attacker (who can induce a hardware hash accelerator fault) to bypass LMS signature verification by reusing stale stack data, resulting in acceptance of an invalid signature. In mbedtls_lms_verify, the return values of the internal Merkle tree functions create_merkle_leaf_value and create_merkle_internal_value are not checked. These functions return an integer that indicates whether the call succeeded or not. If a failure occurs, the output buffer (Tc_candidate_root_node) may remain uninitialized, and the result of the signature verification is unpredictable. When the software implementation of SHA-256 is used, these functions will not fail. However, with hardware-accelerated hashing, an attacker could use fault injection against the accelerator to bypass verification.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/rt: Fix race in push_rt_task

Overview
========
When a CPU chooses to call push_rt_task and picks a task to push to
another CPU's runqueue then it will call find_lock_lowest_rq method
which would take a double lock on both CPUs' runqueues. If one of the
locks aren't readily available, it may lead to dropping the current
runqueue lock and reacquiring both the locks at once. During this window
it is possible that the task is already migrated and is running on some
other CPU. These cases are already handled. However, if the task is
migrated and has already been executed and another CPU is now trying to
wake it up (ttwu) such that it is queued again on the runqeue
(on_rq is 1) and also if the task was run by the same CPU, then the
current checks will pass even though the task was migrated out and is no
longer in the pushable tasks list.

Crashes
=======
This bug resulted in quite a few flavors of crashes triggering kernel
panics with various crash signatures such as assert failures, page
faults, null pointer dereferences, and queue corruption errors all
coming from scheduler itself.

Some of the crashes:

                            CVE-2025-46733 - OP-TEE Secure Storage API Panic Vulnerability
                        </h3>
                        <p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46733
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>OP-TEE is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) designed as companion to a non-secure Linux kernel running on Arm; Cortex-A cores using the TrustZone technology. In version 4.5.0, using a specially crafted tee-supplicant binary running in REE userspace, an attacker can trigger a panic in a TA that uses the libutee Secure Storage API. Many functions in libutee, specifically those which make up the Secure Storage API, will panic if a system call returns an unexpected return code. This behavior is mandated by the TEE Internal Core API specification. However, in OP-TEE’s implementation, return codes of secure storage operations are passed through unsanitized from the REE tee-supplicant, through the Linux kernel tee-driver, through the OP-TEE kernel, back to libutee. Thus, an attacker with access to REE userspace, and the ability to stop tee-supplicant and replace it with their own process (generally trivial for a root user, and depending on the way permissions are set up, potentially available even to less privileged users) can run a malicious tee-supplicant process that responds to storage requests with unexpected response codes, triggering a panic in the requesting TA. This is particularly dangerous for TAs built with `TA_FLAG_SINGLE_INSTANCE` (corresponding to `gpd.ta.singleInstance` and `TA_FLAG_INSTANCE_KEEP_ALIVE` (corresponding to `gpd.ta.keepAlive`). The behavior of these TAs may depend on memory that is preserved between sessions, and the ability of an attacker to panic the TA and reload it with a clean memory space can compromise the behavior of those TAs. A critical example of this is the optee_ftpm TA. It uses the kept alive memory to hold PCR values, which crucially must be non-resettable. An attacker who can trigger a panic in the fTPM TA can reset the PCRs, and then extend them PCRs with whatever they choose, falsifying boot measurements, accessing sealed data, and potentially more. The impact of this issue depends significantly on the behavior of affected TAs. For some, it could manifest as a denial of service, while for others, like the fTPM TA, it can result in the disclosure of sensitive data. Anyone running the fTPM TA is affected, but similar attacks may be possible on other TAs that leverage the Secure Storage API. A fix is available in commit 941a58d78c99c4754fbd4ec3079ec9e1d596af8f.

media: cxusb: no longer judge rbuf when the write fails

syzbot reported a uninit-value in cxusb_i2c_xfer. [1]

Only when the write operation of usb_bulk_msg() in dvb_usb_generic_rw()
succeeds and rlen is greater than 0, the read operation of usb_bulk_msg()
will be executed to read rlen bytes of data from the dvb device into the
rbuf.

In this case, although rlen is 1, the write operation failed which resulted
in the dvb read operation not being executed, and ultimately variable i was
not initialized.

Validate db_agheight, db_agwidth, and db_agstart in dbMount to catch
corrupted metadata early and avoid undefined behavior in dbAllocAG.
Limits are derived from L2LPERCTL, LPERCTL/MAXAG, and CTLTREESIZE:

- agheight: 0 to L2LPERCTL/2 (0 to 5) ensures shift

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: Initialize ssc before laundromat_work to prevent NULL dereference

In nfs4_state_start_net(), laundromat_work may access nfsd_ssc through
nfs4_laundromat -> nfsd4_ssc_expire_umount. If nfsd_ssc isn't initialized,
this can cause NULL pointer dereference.

Normally the delayed start of laundromat_work allows sufficient time for
nfsd_ssc initialization to complete. However, when the kernel waits too
long for userspace responses (e.g. in nfs4_state_start_net ->
nfsd4_end_grace -> nfsd4_record_grace_done -> nfsd4_cld_grace_done ->
cld_pipe_upcall -> __cld_pipe_upcall -> wait_for_completion path), the
delayed work may start before nfsd_ssc initialization finishes.

Fix this by moving nfsd_ssc initialization before starting laundromat_work.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: fix race between nfsd registration and exports_proc

As of now nfsd calls create_proc_exports_entry() at start of init_nfsd
and cleanup by remove_proc_entry() at last of exit_nfsd.

Which causes kernel OOPs if there is race between below 2 operations:
(i) exportfs -r
(ii) mount -t nfsd none /proc/fs/nfsd

and same is happening on latest 6.14 kernel as well:

It reproduced simply with below script:
while [ 1 ]
do
/exportfs -r
done &

while [ 1 ]
do
insmod /nfsd.ko
mount -t nfsd none /proc/fs/nfsd
umount /proc/fs/nfsd
rmmod nfsd
done &

So exporting interfaces to user space shall be done at last and
cleanup at first place.

With change there is no Kernel OOPs.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: kvaser_pciefd: refine error prone echo_skb_max handling logic

echo_skb_max should define the supported upper limit of echo_skb[]
allocated inside the netdevice's priv. The corresponding size value
provided by this driver to alloc_candev() is KVASER_PCIEFD_CAN_TX_MAX_COUNT
which is 17.

But later echo_skb_max is rounded up to the nearest power of two (for the
max case, that would be 32) and the tx/ack indices calculated further
during tx/rx may exceed the upper array boundary. Kasan reported this for
the ack case inside kvaser_pciefd_handle_ack_packet(), though the xmit
function has actually caught the same thing earlier.

 BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in kvaser_pciefd_handle_ack_packet+0x2d7/0x92a drivers/net/can/kvaser_pciefd.c:1528

  </IRQ>

Tx max count definitely matters for kvaser_pciefd_tx_avail(), but for seq
numbers' generation that's not the case - we're free to calculate them as
would be more convenient, not taking tx max count into account. The only
downside is that the size of echo_skb[] should correspond to the max seq
number (not tx max count), so in some situations a bit more memory would
be consumed than could be.

Thus make the size of the underlying echo_skb[] sufficient for the rounded
max tx value.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix out of bounds punch offset

Punching a hole with a start offset that exceeds max_end is not
permitted and will result in a negative length in the
truncate_inode_partial_folio() function while truncating the page cache,
potentially leading to undesirable consequences.

A simple reproducer:

  truncate -s 9895604649994 /mnt/foo
  xfs_io -c "pwrite 8796093022208 4096" /mnt/foo

                        <p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38222

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: inline: fix len overflow in ext4_prepare_inline_data

When running the following code on an ext4 filesystem with inline_data
feature enabled, it will lead to the bug below.

        fd = open("file1", O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0666);
        ftruncate(fd, 30);
        pwrite(fd, "a", 1, (1UL << 40) + 5UL);

That happens because write_begin will succeed as when
ext4_generic_write_inline_data calls ext4_prepare_inline_data, pos + len
will be truncated, leading to ext4_prepare_inline_data parameter to be 6
instead of 0x10000000006.

Then, later when write_end is called, we hit:

        BUG_ON(pos + len > EXT4_I(inode)->i_inline_size);

at ext4_write_inline_data.

Fix it by using a loff_t type for the len parameter in
ext4_prepare_inline_data instead of an unsigned int.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38217
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 45 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (ftsteutates) Fix TOCTOU race in fts_read()

In the fts_read() function, when handling hwmon_pwm_auto_channels_temp,
the code accesses the shared variable data->fan_source[channel] twice
without holding any locks. It is first checked against
FTS_FAN_SOURCE_INVALID, and if the check passes, it is read again
when used as an argument to the BIT() macro.

This creates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition.
Another thread executing fts_update_device() can modify the value of
data->fan_source[channel] between the check and its use. If the value
is changed to FTS_FAN_SOURCE_INVALID (0xff) during this window, the
BIT() macro will be called with a large shift value (BIT(255)).
A bit shift by a value greater than or equal to the type width is
undefined behavior and can lead to a crash or incorrect values being
returned to userspace.

Fix this by reading data->fan_source[channel] into a local variable
once, eliminating the race condition. Additionally, add a bounds check
to ensure the value is less than BITS_PER_LONG before passing it to
the BIT() macro, making the code more robust against undefined behavior.

This possible bug was found by an experimental static analysis tool
developed by our team.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to do sanity check on sit_bitmap_size

w/ below testcase, resize will generate a corrupted image which
contains inconsistent metadata, so when mounting such image, it
will trigger kernel panic:

touch img
truncate -s $((512*1024*1024*1024)) img
mkfs.f2fs -f img $((256*1024*1024))
resize.f2fs -s -i img -t $((1024*1024*1024))
mount img /mnt/f2fs

The reaseon is:

sit_i->bitmap_size is 192, so size of sit bitmap is 192*8=1536, at maximum
there are 1536 sit blocks, however MAIN_SEGS is 261893, so that sit_blk_cnt
is 4762, build_sit_entries() -> current_sit_addr() tries to access
out-of-boundary in sit_bitmap at offset from [1536, 4762), once sit_bitmap
and sit_bitmap_mirror is not the same, it will trigger f2fs_bug_on().

Let's add sanity check in f2fs_sanity_check_ckpt() to avoid panic.

This occurs when processing a symlink inode from the orphan list. The
partial block zeroing code in the truncate path calls
ext4_dirty_journalled_data() -> folio_mark_dirty(). The latter calls
mapping->a_ops->dirty_folio(), but symlink inodes are not assigned an
a_ops vector in ext4, hence the crash.

To avoid this problem, update the ext4_dirty_journalled_data() helper to
only mark the folio dirty on regular files (for which a_ops is
assigned). This also matches the journaling logic in the ext4_symlink()
creation path, where ext4_handle_dirty_metadata() is called directly.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38215

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: Fix do_register_framebuffer to prevent null-ptr-deref in fb_videomode_to_var

If fb_add_videomode() in do_register_framebuffer() fails to allocate
memory for fb_videomode, it will later lead to a null-ptr dereference in
fb_videomode_to_var(), as the fb_info is registered while not having the
mode in modelist that is expected to be there, i.e. the one that is
described in fb_info->var.

================================================================

Even though fbcon_init() checks beforehand if fb_match_mode() in
var_to_display() fails, it can not prevent the panic because fbcon_init()
does not return error code. Considering this and the comment in the code
about fb_match_mode() returning NULL - "This should not happen" - it is
better to prevent registering the fb_info if its mode was not set
successfully. Also move fb_add_videomode() closer to the beginning of
do_register_framebuffer() to avoid having to do the cleanup on fail.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Restore context entry setup order for aliased devices

Commit 2031c469f816 ("iommu/vt-d: Add support for static identity domain")
changed the context entry setup during domain attachment from a
set-and-check policy to a clear-and-reset approach. This inadvertently
introduced a regression affecting PCI aliased devices behind PCIe-to-PCI
bridges.

Specifically, keyboard and touchpad stopped working on several Apple
Macbooks with below messages:

 kernel: input: Apple SPI Keyboard as

Fix this by restoring the previous context setup order.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sch_hfsc: make hfsc_qlen_notify() idempotent

hfsc_qlen_notify() is not idempotent either and not friendly
to its callers, like fq_codel_dequeue(). Let's make it idempotent
to ease qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() callers' life:

1. update_vf() decreases cl->cl_nactive, so we can check whether it is
non-zero before calling it.

2. eltree_remove() always removes RB node cl->el_node, but we can use
   RB_EMPTY_NODE() + RB_CLEAR_NODE() to make it safe.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7066
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Jirafeau normally prevents browser preview for text files due to the possibility that for example SVG and HTML documents could be exploited for cross site scripting. This was done by storing the MIME type of a file and allowing only browser preview for MIME types beginning with image (except for image/svg+xml, see CVE-2022-30110 and CVE-2024-12326), video and audio. However, it was possible to bypass this check by sending a manipulated MIME type containing a comma and an other MIME type like text/html (for example image/png,text/html). Browsers see multiple MIME types and text/html would takes precedence, allowing a possible attacker to do a cross-site scripting attack. The check for MIME types was enhanced to prevent a browser preview when the stored MIME type contains a comma.

thunderbolt: Do not double dequeue a configuration request

Some of our devices crash in tb_cfg_request_dequeue():

 general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdead000000000122

 CPU: 6 PID: 91007 Comm: kworker/6:2 Tainted: G U W 6.6.65
 RIP: 0010:tb_cfg_request_dequeue+0x2d/0xa0
 Call Trace:

 kthread+0xed/0x110
 ret_from_fork+0x38/0x50
 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30

The circumstances are unclear, however, the theory is that
tb_cfg_request_work() can be scheduled twice for a request:
first time via frame.callback from ring_work() and second
time from tb_cfg_request().  Both times kworkers will execute
tb_cfg_request_dequeue(), which results in double list_del()
from the ctl->request_queue (the list poison deference hints
at it: 0xdead000000000122).

Do not dequeue requests that don't have TB_CFG_REQUEST_ACTIVE
bit set.

This 'stress-ng' workload causes the concurrent deletions from

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A flaw was found in the key export functionality of libssh. The issue occurs in the internal function responsible for converting cryptographic keys into serialized formats. During error handling, a memory structure is freed but not cleared, leading to a potential double free issue if an additional failure occurs later in the function. This condition may result in heap corruption or application instability in low-memory scenarios, posing a risk to system reliability where key export operations are performed.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A flaw was found in libssh versions built with OpenSSL versions older than 3.0, specifically in the ssh_kdf() function responsible for key derivation. Due to inconsistent interpretation of return values where OpenSSL uses 0 to indicate failure and libssh uses 0 for success—the function may mistakenly return a success status even when key derivation fails. This results in uninitialized cryptographic key buffers being used in subsequent communication, potentially compromising SSH sessions' confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-5953
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The WP Human Resource Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization in the ajax_insert_employee() and update_empoyee() functions in versions 2.0.0 through 2.2.17. The AJAX handler reads the client-supplied $_POST['role'] and, after basic cleaning via hrm_clean(), passes it directly to wp_insert_user() and later to $user->set_role() without verifying that the current user is allowed to assign that role. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Employee-level access and above, to elevate their privileges to administrator.

<strong>Description : </strong>The WP Human Resource Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary User Deletion due to a missing authorization within the ajax_delete_employee() function in versions 2.0.0 through 2.2.17. The plugin’s deletion handler reads the client-supplied $_POST['delete'] array and passes each ID directly to wp_delete_user() without verifying that the caller has the delete_users capability or limiting which user IDs may be removed. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Employee-level access and above, to delete arbitrary accounts, including administrators.

<strong>Description : </strong>The AI Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to open redirect in version 2.8.4. This is due to an insecure OAuth implementation, as the 'redirect_uri' parameter is missing validation during the authorization flow. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to intercept the authorization code and obtain an access token by redirecting the user to an attacker-controlled URI. Note: OAuth is disabled, the 'Meow_MWAI_Labs_OAuth' class is not loaded in the plugin in the patched version 2.8.5.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. In Next.js App Router from 15.3.0 to before 15.3.3 and Vercel CLI from 41.4.1 to 42.2.0, a cache poisoning vulnerability was found. The issue allowed page requests for HTML content to return a React Server Component (RSC) payload instead under certain conditions. When deployed to Vercel, this would only impact the browser cache, and would not lead to the CDN being poisoned. When self-hosted and deployed externally, this could lead to cache poisoning if the CDN does not properly distinguish between RSC / HTML in the cache keys. This issue has been resolved in Next.js 15.3.3.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>DjVuLibre is a GPL implementation of DjVu, a web-centric format for distributing documents and images. Prior to version 3.5.29, the MMRDecoder::scanruns method is affected by an OOB-write vulnerability, because it does not check that the xr pointer stays within the bounds of the allocated buffer. This can lead to writes beyond the allocated memory, resulting in a heap corruption condition. An out-of-bounds read with pr is also possible for the same reason. This issue has been patched in version 3.5.29.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34061
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A backdoor in PHPStudy versions 2016 through 2018 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on affected installations. The backdoor listens for base64-encoded PHP payloads in the Accept-Charset HTTP header of incoming requests, decodes and executes the payload without proper validation. This leads to remote code execution as the web server user, compromising the affected system.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34082
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A command injection vulnerability exists in IGEL OS versions prior to 11.04.270 within the Secure Terminal and Secure Shadow services. The flaw arises due to improper input sanitization in the handling of specially crafted PROXYCMD commands on TCP ports 30022 and 5900. An unauthenticated attacker with network access to a vulnerable device can inject arbitrary commands, leading to remote code execution with elevated privileges.

NOTE: IGEL OS v10.x has reached end-of-life (EOL) status.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34086
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Bolt CMS versions 3.7.0 and earlier contain a chain of vulnerabilities that together allow an authenticated user to achieve remote code execution. A user with valid credentials can inject arbitrary PHP code into the displayname field of the user profile, which is rendered unsanitized in backend templates. The attacker can then list and rename cached session files via the /async/browse/cache/.sessions and /async/folder/rename endpoints. By renaming a .session file to a path under the publicly accessible /files/ directory with a .php extension, the attacker can turn the injected code into an executable web shell. Finally, the attacker triggers the payload via a crafted HTTP GET request to the rogue file.

NOTE: The vendor announced that Bolt 3 reached end-of-life after 31 December 2021.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated command injection vulnerability exists in Pi-hole versions up to 3.3. When adding a domain to the allowlist via the web interface, the domain parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to append OS commands to the domain string. These commands are executed on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the Pi-hole service user.




This behavior was present in the legacy AdminLTE interface and has since been patched in later versions.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in Remote for Mac, a macOS remote control utility developed by Aexol Studio, in versions up to and including 2025.7. When the application is configured with authentication disabled (i.e., the "Allow unknown devices" option is enabled), the /api/executeScript endpoint is exposed without access control. This allows unauthenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary AppleScript payloads via the X-Script HTTP header, resulting in code execution using do shell script. Successful exploitation grants attackers the ability to run arbitrary commands on the macOS host with the privileges of the Remote for Mac background process.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>wire-ios is an iOS client for the Wire secure messaging application. From Wire iOS 3.111.1 to before 3.124.1, messages that were visible in the view port have been logged to the iOS system logs in clear text. Wire application logs created and managed by the application itself were not affected, especially not the logs users can export and send to Wire support. The iOS logs can only be accessed if someone had (physical) access to the underlying unlocked device. The issue manifested itself by calling canOpenUrl() and passing an invalid URL object. When iOS then performs the check and fails, it logs the contents to the system log. This is not documented behaviour. Wire released an emergency fix with version 3.124.1. As a workaround, users can reset their iOS device to remove the offending logs. Since Wire cannot access or modify iOS system logs, there's no other workaround other than a reset.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48939
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>tarteaucitron.js is a compliant and accessible cookie banner. Prior to version 1.22.0, a vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js where document.currentScript was accessed without verifying that it referenced an actual <script> element. If an attacker injected an HTML element, it could clobber the document.currentScript property. This causes the script to resolve incorrectly to an element instead of the <script> tag, leading to unexpected behavior or failure to load the script path correctly. This issue arises because in some browser environments, named DOM elements become properties on the global document object. An attacker with control over the HTML could exploit this to change the CDN domain of tarteaucitron. This issue has been patched in version 1.22.0.

Dans cette dynamique, les deux agences enrichissent leurs réflexions et harmonisent leurs prises de position au niveau européen sur les règlementations européennes.</p>
<p>Dans ce cadre, elles co-publient aujourd’hui un document conjoint sur la vérification d'identité à distance « Remote Identity Proofing for EUDI Wallet Onboarding : Strengthening Assurance Against Evolving Threats. », suite de la première publication sur le même sujet, mis en ligne en décembre 2023.</p>
<p>En effet, pour mieux répondre aux besoins du marché numérique et renforcer la souveraineté numérique européenne, le cadre réglementaire eIDAS 2 pour l’identification électronique et les services de confiance a été modernisé et adopté en février 2024. Le principal changement structurel apporté par eIDAS 2 repose sur l’introduction d’un European Digital Identity Wallet, portefeuille numérique européen, dont l’obtention peut s’appuyer sur une vérification d’identité à distance.</p>
<p>En cohérence avec ces nouvelles orientations réglementaires, cette seconde édition de ce document conjoint permet de mieux saisir l’engagement de l’ANSSI et du BSI à contribuer activement à l’appropriation du portefeuille numérique européen et à anticiper l’évolution de la menace relative à la vérification d’identité à distance.</p>
<p>La publication met en lumière les progrès réalisés, les défis à relever face aux potentielles attaques et la nécessité d’une approche globale paneuropéenne des tests, de la certification et de la normalisation afin de garantir sécurité, résilience et confiance.</p>

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-43713

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ASNA Assist and ASNA Registrar before 2025-03-31 allow deserialization attacks against .NET remoting. These are Windows system services that support license key management and deprecated Windows network authentication. The services are implemented with .NET remoting and can be exploited via well-known deserialization techniques inherent in the technology. Because the services run with SYSTEM-level rights, exploits can be crafted to achieve escalation of privilege and arbitrary code execution. This affects DataGate for SQL Server 17.0.36.0 and 16.0.89.0, DataGate Component Suite 17.0.36.0 and 16.0.89.0, DataGate Monitor 17.0.26.0 and 16.0.65.0, DataGate WebPak 17.0.37.0 and 16.0.90.0, Monarch for .NET 11.4.50.0 and 10.0.62.0, Encore RPG 4.1.36.0, Visual RPG .NET FW 17.0.37.0 and 16.0.90.0, Visual RPG .NET FW Windows Deployment 17.0.36.0 and 16.0.89.0, WingsRPG 11.0.38.0 and 10.0.95.0, Mobile RPG 11.0.35.0 and 10.0.94.0, Monarch Framework for .NET FW 11.0.36.0 and 10.0.89.0, Browser Terminal 17.0.37.0 and 16.0.90.0, Visual RPG Classic 5.2.7.0 and 5.1.17.0, Visual RPG Deployment 5.2.7.0 and 5.1.17.0, and DataGate Studio 17.0.38.0 and 16.0.104.0.

<strong>Description : </strong>The Migration, Backup, Staging – WPvivid Backup & Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'wpvivid_upload_import_files' function in all versions up to, and including, 0.9.116. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. NOTE: Uploaded files are only accessible on WordPress instances running on the NGINX web server as the existing .htaccess within the target file upload folder prevents access on Apache servers.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>n8n is a workflow automation platform. Prior to version 1.99.0, there is a denial of Service vulnerability in /rest/binary-data endpoint when processing empty filesystem URIs (filesystem:// or filesystem-v2://). This allows authenticated attackers to cause service unavailability through malformed filesystem URI requests, effecting the /rest/binary-data endpoint and n8n.cloud instances (confirmed HTTP/2 524 timeout responses). Attackers can exploit this by sending GET requests with empty filesystem URIs (filesystem:// or filesystem-v2://) to the /rest/binary-data endpoint, causing resource exhaustion and service disruption. This issue has been patched in version 1.99.0.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 54 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The VNC authentication mechanism bases on a challenge-response system where both server and client use the same password for encryption. The challenge is sent from the server to the client, is encrypted by the client and sent back. The server does the same encryption locally and if the responses match it is prooven that the client knows the correct password. Since all VNC communication is unencrypted, an attacker can obtain the challenge and response and try to derive the password from this information.

<strong>Description : </strong>A cross-site scripting vulnerability is present in the hotspot of MikroTik's RouterOS on versions below 7.19.2. An attacker can inject the `javascript` protocol in the `dst` parameter. When the victim browses to the malicious URL and logs in, the XSS executes. The POST request used to login, can also be converted to a GET request, allowing an attacker to send a specifically crafted URL that automatically logs in the victim (into the attacker's account) and triggers the payload.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Multiple plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's bundled Magnific Popups library (version 1.1.0) in various versions due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: This vulnerability was fixed in the upstream library (Magnific Popups version 1.2.0) by disabling the loading of HTML within certain fields by default.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>System environment variables are recorded in Docker Desktop diagnostic logs, when using shell auto-completion. This leads to unintentional disclosure of sensitive information such as api keys, passwords, etc. 
A malicious actor with read access to these logs could obtain secrets and further use them to gain unauthorized access to other systems. Starting with version 4.43.0 Docker Desktop no longer logs system environment variables as part of diagnostics log collection.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/cma: Fix hang when cma_netevent_callback fails to queue_work

The cited commit fixed a crash when cma_netevent_callback was called for
a cma_id while work on that id from a previous call had not yet started.
The work item was re-initialized in the second call, which corrupted the
work item currently in the work queue.

However, it left a problem when queue_work fails (because the item is
still pending in the work queue from a previous call). In this case,
cma_id_put (which is called in the work handler) is therefore not
called. This results in a userspace process hang (zombie process).

Fix this by calling cma_id_put() if queue_work fails.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: aqc111: fix error handling of usbnet read calls

Syzkaller, courtesy of syzbot, identified an error (see report [1]) in
aqc111 driver, caused by incomplete sanitation of usb read calls'
results. This problem is quite similar to the one fixed in commit
920a9fa27e78 ("net: asix: add proper error handling of usb read errors").

For instance, usbnet_read_cmd() may read fewer than 'size' bytes,
even if the caller expected the full amount, and aqc111_read_cmd()
will not check its result properly. As [1] shows, this may lead
to MAC address in aqc111_bind() being only partly initialized,
triggering KMSAN warnings.

Fix the issue by verifying that the number of bytes read is
as expected and not less.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38154
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, sockmap: Avoid using sk_socket after free when sending

The sk->sk_socket is not locked or referenced in backlog thread, and
during the call to skb_send_sock(), there is a race condition with
the release of sk_socket. All types of sockets(tcp/udp/unix/vsock)
will be affected.

Race conditions:
'''
CPU0                               CPU1

backlog::skb_send_sock
  sendmsg_unlocked
    sock_sendmsg
      sock_sendmsg_nosec
                                   close(fd):
                                     ...
                                     ops->release() -> sock_map_close()
                                     sk_socket->ops = NULL
                                     free(socket)
      sock->ops->sendmsg
            ^
            panic here
'''

The ref of psock become 0 after sock_map_close() executed.
'''
void sock_map_close()
{
    ...
    if (likely(psock)) {
    ...
    // !! here we remove psock and the ref of psock become 0
    sock_map_remove_links(sk, psock)
    psock = sk_psock_get(sk);
    if (unlikely(!psock))
        goto no_psock; <=== Control jumps here via goto
        ...
        cancel_delayed_work_sync(&psock->work); <=== not executed
        sk_psock_put(sk, psock);
        ...
}
'''

Based on the fact that we already wait for the workqueue to finish in
sock_map_close() if psock is held, we simply increase the psock
reference count to avoid race conditions.

With this patch, if the backlog thread is running, sock_map_close() will
wait for the backlog thread to complete and cancel all pending work.

If no backlog running, any pending work that hasn't started by then will
fail when invoked by sk_psock_get(), as the psock reference count have
been zeroed, and sk_psock_drop() will cancel all jobs via
cancel_delayed_work_sync().

In summary, we require synchronization to coordinate the backlog thread
and close() thread.

The panic I catched:
'''

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hisi_acc_vfio_pci: fix XQE dma address error

The dma addresses of EQE and AEQE are wrong after migration and
results in guest kernel-mode encryption services  failure.
Comparing the definition of hardware registers, we found that
there was an error when the data read from the register was
combined into an address. Therefore, the address combination
sequence needs to be corrected.

Even after fixing the above problem, we still have an issue
where the Guest from an old kernel can get migrated to
new kernel and may result in wrong data.

In order to ensure that the address is correct after migration,
if an old magic number is detected, the dma address needs to be
updated.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: bcm: rpi: Add NULL check in raspberrypi_clk_register()

devm_kasprintf() returns NULL when memory allocation fails. Currently,
raspberrypi_clk_register() does not check for this case, which results
in a NULL pointer dereference.

Add NULL check after devm_kasprintf() to prevent this issue.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/mlx5: Fix error flow upon firmware failure for RQ destruction

Upon RQ destruction if the firmware command fails which is the
last resource to be destroyed some SW resources were already cleaned
regardless of the failure.

Now properly rollback the object to its original state upon such failure.

In order to avoid a use-after free in case someone tries to destroy the
object again, which results in the following kernel trace:
refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38162

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: prevent overflow in lookup table allocation

When calculating the lookup table size, ensure the following
multiplication does not overflow:

- desc->field_len[] maximum value is U8_MAX multiplied by
  NFT_PIPAPO_GROUPS_PER_BYTE(f) that can be 2, worst case.
- NFT_PIPAPO_BUCKETS(f->bb) is 2^8, worst case.
- sizeof(unsigned long), from sizeof(*f->lt), lt in
  struct nft_pipapo_field.

Then, use check_mul_overflow() to multiply by bucket size and then use
check_add_overflow() to the alignment for avx2 (if needed). Finally, add
lt_size_check_overflow() helper and use it to consolidate this.

While at it, replace leftover allocation using the GFP_KERNEL to
GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT for consistency, in pipapo_resize().

not trigger panic for such case, instead, let's print log and
set fsck flag.

The reason is f2fs_gc_range() may try to migrate block in curseg, however,
its SSA block is not uptodate due to the last summary block data is still
in cache of curseg.

In this patch, we add a condition in f2fs_gc_range() to check whether
section is opened or not, and skip block migration for opened section.

The panic originates from the assertion BUG_ON(skb_shared(skb)) in
skb_linearize(). A previous commit(see Fixes tag) introduced skb_get()
to avoid race conditions between skb operations in the backlog and skb
release in the recvmsg path. However, this caused the panic to always
occur when skb_linearize is executed.

The "--rx-strp 100000" parameter forces the RX path to use the strparser
module which aggregates data until it reaches 100KB before calling sockmap
logic. The 100KB payload exceeds MAX_MSG_FRAGS, triggering skb_linearize.

To fix this issue, just move skb_get into sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue.

Note that for verdict_apply path, the skb_get operation is unnecessary so
we add 'take_ref' param to control it's behavior.

After calling bpf_exec_tx_verdict(), the size of msg_pl->sg may increase,
e.g., when the BPF program executes bpf_msg_push_data().

If the BPF program sets cork_bytes and sg.size is smaller than cork_bytes,
it will return -ENOSPC and attempt to roll back to the non-zero copy
logic. However, during rollback, msg->msg_iter is reset, but since
msg_pl->sg.size has been increased, subsequent executions will exceed the
actual size of msg_iter.
'''
iov_iter_revert(&msg->msg_iter, msg_pl->sg.size - orig_size);
'''

The changes in this commit are based on the following considerations:

1. When cork_bytes is set, rolling back to non-zero copy logic is
pointless and can directly go to zero-copy logic.

2. We can not calculate the correct number of bytes to revert msg_iter.

Assume the original data is "abcdefgh" (8 bytes), and after 3 pushes
by the BPF program, it becomes 11-byte data: "abc?de?fgh?".
Then, we set cork_bytes to 6, which means the first 6 bytes have been
processed, and the remaining 5 bytes "?fgh?" will be cached until the
length meets the cork_bytes requirement.

However, some data in "?fgh?" is not within 'sg->msg_iter'
(but in msg_pl instead), especially the data "?" we pushed.

So it doesn't seem as simple as just reverting through an offset of
msg_iter.

3. For non-TLS sockets in tcp_bpf_sendmsg, when a "cork" situation occurs,
the user-space send() doesn't return an error, and the returned length is
the same as the input length parameter, even if some data is cached.

Additionally, I saw that the current non-zero-copy logic for handling
corking is written as:
'''
line 1177
else if (ret != -EAGAIN) {
	if (ret == -ENOSPC)
		ret = 0;
	goto send_end;
'''

So it's ok to just return 'copied' without error when a "cork" situation
occurs.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: handle hdr_first_de() return value

The hdr_first_de() function returns a pointer to a struct NTFS_DE. This
pointer may be NULL. To handle the NULL error effectively, it is important
to implement an error handler. This will help manage potential errors
consistently.

Additionally, error handling for the return value already exists at other
points where this function is called.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/fpsimd: Avoid clobbering kernel FPSIMD state with SMSTOP

On system with SME, a thread's kernel FPSIMD state may be erroneously
clobbered during a context switch immediately after that state is
restored. Systems without SME are unaffected.

If the CPU happens to be in streaming SVE mode before a context switch
to a thread with kernel FPSIMD state, fpsimd_thread_switch() will
restore the kernel FPSIMD state using fpsimd_load_kernel_state() while
the CPU is still in streaming SVE mode. When fpsimd_thread_switch()
subsequently calls fpsimd_flush_cpu_state(), this will execute an
SMSTOP, causing an exit from streaming SVE mode. The exit from
streaming SVE mode will cause the hardware to reset a number of
FPSIMD/SVE/SME registers, clobbering the FPSIMD state.

Fix this by calling fpsimd_flush_cpu_state() before restoring the kernel
FPSIMD state.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/fpsimd: Discard stale CPU state when handling SME traps

The logic for handling SME traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SME set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SME traps enabled). This can result in warnings from
do_sme_acc() where SME traps are not expected while TIF_SME is set:

|        /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */
|        if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))
|                WARN_ON(1);

This is very similar to the SVE issue we fixed in commit:

  751ecf6afd6568ad ("arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps")

The race can occur when the SME trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sme_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SME clear, SME traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))
|                 WARN_ON(1);
|
|         if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                 unsigned long vq_minus_one =
|                         sve_vq_from_vl(task_get_sme_vl(current)) - 1;
|                 sme_set_vq(vq_minus_one);
|
|                 fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu();
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SME traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38172

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: avoid using multiple devices with different type

For multiple devices, both primary and extra devices should be the
same type. `erofs_init_device` has already guaranteed that if the
primary is a file-backed device, extra devices should also be
regular files.

However, if the primary is a block device while the extra device
is a file-backed device, `erofs_init_device` will get an ENOTBLK,
which is not treated as an error in `erofs_fc_get_tree`, and that
leads to an UAF:

  erofs_fc_get_tree
    get_tree_bdev_flags(erofs_fc_fill_super)
      erofs_read_superblock
        erofs_init_device  // sbi->dif0 is not inited yet,
                           // return -ENOTBLK
      deactivate_locked_super
        free(sbi)
    if (err is -ENOTBLK)
      sbi->dif0.file = filp_open()  // sbi UAF

So if -ENOTBLK is hitted in `erofs_init_device`, it means the
primary device must be a block device, and the extra device
is not a block device. The error can be converted to -EINVAL.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: mscc: Fix memory leak when using one step timestamping

Fix memory leak when running one-step timestamping. When running
one-step sync timestamping, the HW is configured to insert the TX time
into the frame, so there is no reason to keep the skb anymore. As in
this case the HW will never generate an interrupt to say that the frame
was timestamped, then the frame will never released.
Fix this by freeing the frame in case of one-step timestamping.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38149

<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 53 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: clear phydev->devlink when the link is deleted

There is a potential crash issue when disabling and re-enabling the
network port. When disabling the network port, phy_detach() calls
device_link_del() to remove the device link, but it does not clear
phydev->devlink, so phydev->devlink is not a NULL pointer. Then the
network port is re-enabled, but if phy_attach_direct() fails before
calling device_link_add(), the code jumps to the "error" label and
calls phy_detach(). Since phydev->devlink retains the old value from
the previous attach/detach cycle, device_link_del() uses the old value,
which accesses a NULL pointer and causes a crash. The simplified crash
log is as follows.

[   24.702421] Call trace:
[   24.704856]  device_link_put_kref+0x20/0x120
[   24.709124]  device_link_del+0x30/0x48
[   24.712864]  phy_detach+0x24/0x168

[   24.725140]  phylink_of_phy_connect+0x1c/0x34

Therefore, phydev->devlink needs to be cleared when the device link is
deleted.

Calling `PACKET_ADD_MEMBERSHIP` on an ops-locked device can trigger
the `NETDEV_UNREGISTER` notifier, which may require disabling promiscuous
and/or allmulti mode. Both of these operations require acquiring
the netdev instance lock.

Move the call to `packet_dev_mc` outside of the RCU critical section.
The `mclist` modifications (add, del, flush, unregister) are protected by
the RTNL, not the RCU. The RCU only protects the `sklist` and its
associated `sks`. The delayed operation on the `mclist` entry remains
within the RTNL.

<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in Lucee’s administrative interface due to insecure design in the scheduled task functionality. An administrator with access to /lucee/admin/web.cfm can configure a scheduled job to retrieve a remote .cfm file from an attacker-controlled server, which is written to the Lucee webroot and executed with the privileges of the Lucee service account. Because Lucee does not enforce integrity checks, path restrictions, or execution controls for scheduled task fetches, this feature can be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated virtual machine escape vulnerability exists in HashiCorp Vagrant when using the default synced folder configuration. By design, Vagrant automatically mounts the host system’s project directory into the guest VM under /vagrant (or C:\vagrant on Windows). This includes the Vagrantfile configuration file, which is a Ruby script evaluated by the host every time a vagrant command is executed in the project directory. If a low-privileged attacker obtains shell access to the guest VM, they can append arbitrary Ruby code to the mounted Vagrantfile. When a user on the host later runs any vagrant command, the injected code is executed on the host with that user’s privileges.

 While this shared-folder behavior is well-documented by Vagrant, the security implications of Vagrantfile execution from guest-writable storage are not explicitly addressed. This effectively enables guest-to-host code execution in multi-tenant or adversarial VM scenarios.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated local file inclusion vulnerability exists in Microweber CMS versions <= 1.2.11 through misuse of the backup management API. Authenticated users can abuse the /api/BackupV2/upload and /api/BackupV2/download endpoints to read arbitrary files from the underlying filesystem. By specifying an absolute file path in the src parameter of the upload request, the server may relocate or delete the target file depending on the web service user’s privileges. The corresponding download endpoint can then be used to retrieve the file contents, effectively enabling local file disclosure. This behavior stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied paths and inadequate restrictions on file access and backup logic.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34078
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in NSClient++ 0.5.2.35 when both the web interface and ExternalScripts features are enabled. The configuration file (nsclient.ini) stores the administrative password in plaintext and is readable by local users. By extracting this password, an attacker can authenticate to the NSClient++ web interface (typically accessible on port 8443) and abuse the ExternalScripts plugin to inject and execute arbitrary commands as SYSTEM by registering a custom script, saving the configuration, and triggering it via the API.

This behavior is documented but insecure, as the plaintext credential exposure undermines access isolation between local users and administrative functions.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34079

<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in NSClient++ version 0.5.2.35 when the web interface and ExternalScripts module are enabled. A remote attacker with the administrator password can authenticate to the web interface (default port 8443), inject arbitrary commands as external scripts via the /settings/query.json API, save the configuration, and trigger the script via the /query/{name} endpoint. The injected commands are executed with SYSTEM privileges, enabling full remote compromise.

This capability is an intended feature, but the lack of safeguards or privilege separation makes it risky when exposed to untrusted actors.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34090

<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A security bypass vulnerability exists in Google Chrome AppBound cookie encryption mechanism due to insufficient validation of COM server paths during inter-process communication. A local low-privileged attacker can hijack the COM class identifier (CLSID) registration used by Chrome's elevation service and point it to a non-existent or malicious binary. When this hijack occurs, Chrome silently falls back to the legacy cookie encryption mechanism (protected only by user-DPAPI), thereby enabling cookie decryption by any user-context malware without SYSTEM-level access. This flaw bypasses the protections intended by the AppBound encryption design and allows cookie theft from Chromium-based browsers.

Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.

                        <p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34091
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A padding oracle vulnerability exists in Google Chrome’s AppBound cookie encryption mechanism due to observable decryption failure behavior in Windows Event Logs when handling malformed ciphertext in SYSTEM-DPAPI-encrypted blobs. A local attacker can repeatedly send malformed ciphertexts to the Chrome elevation service and distinguish between padding and MAC errors, enabling a padding oracle attack. This allows partial decryption of the SYSTEM-DPAPI layer and eventual recovery of the user-DPAPI encrypted cookie key, which is trivially decrypted by the attacker’s own context. This issue undermines the core purpose of AppBound Encryption by enabling low-privileged cookie theft through cryptographic misuse and verbose error feedback.

Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.

This behavior arises from a combination of Chrome’s AppBound implementation and the way Microsoft Windows DPAPI reports decryption failures via Event Logs. As such, the vulnerability relies on cryptographic behavior and error visibility in all supported versions of Windows.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34092

<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A cookie encryption bypass vulnerability exists in Google Chrome’s AppBound mechanism due to weak path validation logic within the elevation service. When Chrome encrypts a cookie key, it records its own executable path as validation metadata. Later, when decrypting, the elevation service compares the requesting process’s path to this stored path. However, due to path canonicalization inconsistencies, an attacker can impersonate Chrome (e.g., by naming their binary chrome.exe and placing it in a similar path) and successfully retrieve the encrypted cookie key. This allows malicious processes to retrieve cookies intended to be restricted to the Chrome process only.

Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-20309
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 14 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to an affected device using the root account, which has default, static credentials that cannot be changed or deleted.

This vulnerability is due to the presence of static user credentials for the root account that are reserved for use during development. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the account to log in to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the affected system and execute arbitrary commands as the root user.

<strong>Description : </strong>kotaemon is an open-source RAG-based tool for document comprehension. From versions 0.10.6 and prior, in libs/ktem/ktem/index/file/ui.py, the index_fn method accepts both URLs and local file paths without validation. The pipeline streams these paths directly and stores them, enabling attackers to traverse directories (e.g. ../../../../../.env) and exfiltrate sensitive files. This issue has been patched via commit 37cdc28, in version 0.10.7 which has not been made public at time of publication.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53359

<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 15 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ethereum is a common ethereum structs for Rust. Prior to ethereum crate v0.18.0, signature malleability (according to EIP-2) was only checked for "legacy" transactions, but not for EIP-2930, EIP-1559 and EIP-7702 transactions. This is a specification deviation. The signature malleability itself is not a security issue and not as high of a risk if the ethereum crate is used on a single-implementation blockchain. This issue has been patched in version v0.18.0. A workaround for this issue involves manually checking transaction malleability outside of the crate, however upgrading is recommended.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100: Add GPU cooling

Unlike the CPU, the GPU does not throttle its speed automatically when it
reaches high temperatures. With certain high GPU loads it is possible to
reach the critical hardware shutdown temperature of 120°C, endangering the
hardware and making it impossible to run certain applications.

Set up GPU cooling similar to the ACPI tables, by throttling the GPU speed
when reaching 95°C and polling every 200ms.

<strong>Description : </strong>ModSecurity is an open source, cross platform web application firewall (WAF) engine for Apache, IIS and Nginx. In versions 2.9.8 to before 2.9.11, an empty XML tag can cause a segmentation fault. If SecParseXmlIntoArgs is set to On or OnlyArgs, and the request type is application/xml, and at least one XML tag is empty (eg <foo></foo>), then a segmentation fault occurs. This issue has been patched in version 2.9.11. A workaround involves setting SecParseXmlIntoArgs to Off.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53106
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 53 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Graylog is a free and open log management platform. In versions 6.2.0 to before 6.2.4 and 6.3.0-alpha.1 to before 6.3.0-rc.2, Graylog users can gain elevated privileges by creating and using API tokens for the local Administrator or any other user for whom the malicious user knows the ID. For the attack to succeed, the attacker needs a user account in Graylog. They can then proceed to issue hand-crafted requests to the Graylog REST API and exploit a weak permission check for token creation. This issue has been patched in versions 6.2.4 and 6.3.0-rc.2. A workaround involves disabling the respective configuration found in System > Configuration > Users > "Allow users to create personal access tokens".

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A remote code execution vulnerability in GFI Kerio Control 9.4.5 allows attackers with administrative access to upload and execute arbitrary code through the firmware upgrade feature. The system upgrade mechanism accepts unsigned .img files, which can be modified to include malicious scripts within the upgrade.sh or disk image components. These modified upgrade images are not validated for authenticity or integrity, and are executed by the system post-upload, enabling root access.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34072
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A data exfiltration vulnerability exists in Anthropic’s deprecated Slack Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server via automatic link unfurling. When an AI agent using the Slack MCP Server processes untrusted data, it can be manipulated to generate messages containing attacker-crafted hyperlinks embedding sensitive data. Slack’s link preview bots (e.g., Slack-LinkExpanding, Slackbot, Slack-ImgProxy) will then issue outbound requests to the attacker-controlled URL, resulting in zero-click exfiltration of private data.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34073
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unauthenticated command injection vulnerability exists in stamparm/maltrail (Maltrail) versions <=0.54. A remote attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands via the username parameter in a POST request to the /login endpoint. This occurs due to unsafe handling of user-supplied input passed to subprocess.check_output() in core/http.py, allowing injection of shell metacharacters. Exploitation does not require authentication and commands are executed with the privileges of the Maltrail process.

<strong>Description : </strong>Linkwarden is a self-hosted, open-source collaborative bookmark manager to collect, organize and archive webpages. In version 2.10.2, the server accepts links of format file:///etc/passwd and doesn't do any validation before sending them to parsers and playwright, this can result in leak of other user's links (and in some cases it might be possible to leak environment secrets). This issue has been patched in version 2.10.3 which has not been made public at time of publication.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability exists in the applyCT component of the Hikvision Integrated Security Management Platform due to the use of a vulnerable version of the Fastjson library. The endpoint /bic/ssoService/v1/applyCT deserializes untrusted user input, allowing an attacker to trigger Fastjson's auto-type feature to load arbitrary Java classes. By referencing a malicious class via an LDAP URL, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the underlying system.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34069
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in GFI Kerio Control 9.4.5 due to insecure default proxy configuration and weak access control in the GFIAgent service. The non-transparent proxy on TCP port 3128 can be used to forward unauthenticated requests to internal services such as GFIAgent, bypassing firewall restrictions and exposing internal management endpoints. This enables unauthenticated attackers to access the GFIAgent service on ports 7995 and 7996, retrieve the appliance UUID, and issue administrative requests via the proxy. Exploitation results in full administrative access to the Kerio Control appliance.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34070

<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A missing authentication vulnerability in the GFIAgent component of GFI Kerio Control 9.4.5 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform privileged operations. The GFIAgent service, responsible for integration with GFI AppManager, exposes HTTP services on ports 7995 and 7996 without proper authentication. The /proxy handler on port 7996 allows arbitrary forwarding to administrative endpoints when provided with an Appliance UUID, which itself can be retrieved from port 7995. This results in a complete authentication bypass, permitting access to sensitive administrative APIs.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-24332
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 6 hours, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Nokia Single RAN AirScale baseband allows an authenticated administrative user access to all physical boards after performing a single login to the baseband system board. The baseband does not re-authenticate the user when they connect from the baseband system board to the baseband capacity boards using the internal bsoc SSH service, which is available only internally within the baseband and through the internal backplane between the boards. The bsoc SSH allows login from one board to another via the baseband internal backplane using an SSH private key present on the baseband system board.

This bsoc SSH capability was previously considered an administrative functionality but has now been restricted to be available only to baseband root-privileged administrators. This restriction mitigates the possibility of misuse with lower-level privileges (e.g., from baseband software images). This mitigation is included starting from release 23R4-SR 3.0 MP and later

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Nokia Single RAN baseband software earlier than 24R1-SR 1.0 MP contains administrative shell input validation fault, which authenticated admin user can, in theory, potentially use for injecting arbitrary commands for unprivileged baseband OAM service process execution via special characters added to baseband internal COMA_config.xml file.

This issue has been corrected starting from release 24R1-SR 1.0 MP and later, by adding proper input validation to OAM service process which prevents injecting special characters via baseband internal COMA_config.xml file.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Single RAN baseband OAM service is intended to run as an unprivileged service. However, it initially starts with root privileges and assigns certain capabilities before dropping to an unprivileged level. The capabilities retained from the root period are considered extensive after the privilege drop and, in theory, could potentially allow actions beyond the intended scope of the OAM service. These actions could include gaining root privileges, accessing root-owned files, modifying them as the file owner, and then returning them to root ownership. This issue has been corrected starting from release 24R1-SR 0.2 MP and later.

Beginning with release 24R1-SR 0.2 MP, the OAM service software capabilities are restricted to the minimum necessary.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The education theme for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.10 via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'themerex_callback_view_more_posts' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.

                        <p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6464
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 7 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Forminator Forms – Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.44.2 via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'entry_delete_upload_files' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object through a PHAR file. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. Deserialization occurs when the form submission is deleted, whether by an Administrator or via auto-deletion determined by plugin settings.

<strong>Description : </strong>The Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload (Pro) - WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the dnd_upload_cf7_upload_chunks() function in version 5.0 - 5.0.5 (when bundled with the PrintSpace theme) and all versions up to, and including, 1.7.1 (in the standalone version). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. The execution of PHP is disabled via a .htaccess file but is still possible in certain server configurations.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-46993
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 1, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 10 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Electron is an open source framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In versions prior to 28.3.2, 29.3.3, and 30.0.3, the nativeImage.createFromPath() and nativeImage.createFromBuffer() functions call a function downstream that is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. An Electron program that uses either of the affected functions is vulnerable to a buffer overflow if an attacker is in control of the image's height, width, and contents. This issue has been patched in versions  28.3.2, 29.3.3, and 30.0.3. There are no workarounds for this issue.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-49364

<strong>Published : </strong> July 1, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 10 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>tiny-secp256k1 is a tiny secp256k1 native/JS wrapper. Prior to version 1.1.7, a private key can be extracted on signing a malicious JSON-stringifiable object, when global Buffer is the buffer package. This affects only environments where require('buffer') is the NPM buffer package. The Buffer.isBuffer check can be bypassed, resulting in k reuse for different messages, leading to private key extraction over a single invalid message (and a second one for which any message/signature could be taken, e.g. previously known valid one). This issue has been patched in version 1.1.7.

This only impacts apps that have the embeddedAsarIntegrityValidation and onlyLoadAppFromAsar fuses enabled. Apps without these fuses enabled are not impacted. This issue is specific to Windows, apps using these fuses on macOS are not impacted. Specifically this issue can only be exploited if the app is launched from a filesystem the attacker has write access too. i.e. the ability to edit files inside the .app bundle on macOS which these fuses are supposed to protect against. This issue has been patched in versions 30.0.5 and 31.0.0-beta.1. There are no workarounds for this issue.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53095

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Sunshine is a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight. Prior to version 2025.628.4510, the web UI of Sunshine lacks protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious web page that, when visited by an authenticated user, can trigger unintended actions within the Sunshine application on behalf of that user. Specifically, since the application does OS command execution by design, this issue can be exploited to abuse the "Command Preparations" feature, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed with Administrator privileges when an application is launched. This issue has been patched in version 2025.628.4510.

<strong>Description : </strong>File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. Prior to version 2.33.9, access tokens are used as GET parameters. The JSON Web Token (JWT) which is used as a session identifier will get leaked to anyone having access to the URLs accessed by the user. This will give an attacker full access to a user's account and, in consequence, to all sensitive files the user has access to. This issue has been patched in version 2.33.9.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. Prior to version 2.33.10, the implementation of the allowlist is erroneous, allowing a user to execute more shell commands than they are authorized for. The concrete impact of this vulnerability depends on the commands configured, and the binaries installed on the server or in the container image. Due to the missing separation of scopes on the OS-level, this could give an attacker access to all files managed the application, including the File Browser database. This issue has been patched in version 2.33.10.

In versions 2.32.0 and prior, the implementation of password protected links is error-prone, resulting in potential unprotected sharing of a file through a direct download link. This link can either be shared unknowingly by a user or discovered from various locations such as the browser history or the log of a proxy server used. At time of publication, no known patched versions are available.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46702
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Mattermost versions 10.5.x <= 10.5.5, 9.11.x <= 9.11.15, 10.8.x <= 10.8.0, 10.7.x <= 10.7.2, 10.6.x <= 10.6.5 fail to properly enforce channel member management permissions when adding participants to playbook runs. This allows authenticated users with member-level permissions to bypass system admin restrictions and add or remove users to/from private channels via the playbook run participants feature, even when the 'Manage Members' permission has been explicitly removed. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive channel content and allow guest users to gain channel management privileges.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Host Header Injection (HHI) vulnerability in the Hotspot Shield VPN client, which can induce unexpected behaviour when accessing third-party web applications through the VPN tunnel. Although such applications do not present this vulnerability per se, the use of the tunnel, together with a forged Host header, can cause the VPN client to redirect or forward HTTP requests to servers other than those originally intended, leading to consequences such as open redirects or delivery of traffic to infrastructure controlled by an attacker. This does not imply a flaw in the target applications, but in how the VPN client internally handles outgoing headers and requests.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers/rapidio/rio_cm.c: prevent possible heap overwrite

In

riocm_cdev_ioctl(RIO_CM_CHAN_SEND)
   -> cm_chan_msg_send()
      -> riocm_ch_send()

cm_chan_msg_send() checks that userspace didn't send too much data but
riocm_ch_send() failed to check that userspace sent sufficient data.  The
result is that riocm_ch_send() can write to fields in the rio_ch_chan_hdr
which were outside the bounds of the space which cm_chan_msg_send()
allocated.

Address this by teaching riocm_ch_send() to check that the entire
rio_ch_chan_hdr was copied in from userspace.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38089

<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sunrpc: handle SVC_GARBAGE during svc auth processing as auth error

tianshuo han reported a remotely-triggerable crash if the client sends a
kernel RPC server a specially crafted packet. If decoding the RPC reply
fails in such a way that SVC_GARBAGE is returned without setting the
rq_accept_statp pointer, then that pointer can be dereferenced and a
value stored there.

If it's the first time the thread has processed an RPC, then that
pointer will be set to NULL and the kernel will crash. In other cases,
it could create a memory scribble.

The server sunrpc code treats a SVC_GARBAGE return from svc_authenticate
or pg_authenticate as if it should send a GARBAGE_ARGS reply. RFC 5531
says that if authentication fails that the RPC should be rejected
instead with a status of AUTH_ERR.

Handle a SVC_GARBAGE return as an AUTH_ERROR, with a reason of
AUTH_BADCRED instead of returning GARBAGE_ARGS in that case. This
sidesteps the whole problem of touching the rpc_accept_statp pointer in
this situation and avoids the crash.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38086

<strong>Published : </strong> June 28, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 12 hours, 24 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ch9200: fix uninitialised access during mii_nway_restart

In mii_nway_restart() the code attempts to call
mii->mdio_read which is ch9200_mdio_read(). ch9200_mdio_read()
utilises a local buffer called "buff", which is initialised
with control_read(). However "buff" is conditionally
initialised inside control_read():

        if (err == size) {
                memcpy(data, buf, size);
        }

If the condition of "err == size" is not met, then
"buff" remains uninitialised. Once this happens the
uninitialised "buff" is accessed and returned during
ch9200_mdio_read():

        return (buff[0] | buff[1] << 8);

The problem stems from the fact that ch9200_mdio_read()
ignores the return value of control_read(), leading to
uinit-access of "buff".

To fix this we should check the return value of
control_read() and return early on error.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38084
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 28, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 11 hours, 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb: unshare page tables during VMA split, not before

Currently, __split_vma() triggers hugetlb page table unsharing through
vm_ops->may_split().  This happens before the VMA lock and rmap locks are
taken - which is too early, it allows racing VMA-locked page faults in our
process and racing rmap walks from other processes to cause page tables to
be shared again before we actually perform the split.

Fix it by explicitly calling into the hugetlb unshare logic from
__split_vma() in the same place where THP splitting also happens.  At that
point, both the VMA and the rmap(s) are write-locked.

An annoying detail is that we can now call into the helper
hugetlb_unshare_pmds() from two different locking contexts:

1. from hugetlb_split(), holding:
    - mmap lock (exclusively)
    - VMA lock
    - file rmap lock (exclusively)
2. hugetlb_unshare_all_pmds(), which I think is designed to be able to
   call us with only the mmap lock held (in shared mode), but currently
   only runs while holding mmap lock (exclusively) and VMA lock

Backporting note:
This commit fixes a racy protection that was introduced in commit
b30c14cd6102 ("hugetlb: unshare some PMDs when splitting VMAs"); that
commit claimed to fix an issue introduced in 5.13, but it should actually
also go all the way back.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb: fix huge_pmd_unshare() vs GUP-fast race

huge_pmd_unshare() drops a reference on a page table that may have
previously been shared across processes, potentially turning it into a
normal page table used in another process in which unrelated VMAs can
afterwards be installed.

If this happens in the middle of a concurrent gup_fast(), gup_fast() could
end up walking the page tables of another process.  While I don't see any
way in which that immediately leads to kernel memory corruption, it is
really weird and unexpected.

Fix it with an explicit broadcast IPI through tlb_remove_table_sync_one(),
just like we do in khugepaged when removing page tables for a THP
collapse.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53097

<strong>Published : </strong> June 27, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 36 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent. Prior to version 3.20.3, there was an issue where the Roo Code agent's `search_files` tool did not respect the setting to disable reads outside of the VS Code workspace. This means that an attacker who was able to inject a prompt into the agent could potentially read a sensitive file and then write the information to a JSON schema. Users have the option to disable schema fetching in VS Code, but the feature is enabled by default. For users with this feature enabled, writing to the schema would trigger a network request without the user having a chance to deny. This issue is of moderate severity, since it requires the attacker to already be able to submit prompts to the agent. Version 3.20.3 fixed the issue where `search_files` did not respect the setting to limit it to the workspace. This reduces the scope of the damage if an attacker is able to take control of the agent through prompt injection or another vector.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53098

<strong>Published : </strong> June 27, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 36 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent. The project-specific MCP configuration for the Roo Code agent is stored in the `.roo/mcp.json` file within the VS Code workspace. Because the MCP configuration format allows for execution of arbitrary commands, prior to version 3.20.3, it would have been possible for an attacker with access to craft a prompt to ask the agent to write a malicious command to the MCP configuration file. If the user had opted-in to auto-approving file writes within the project, this would have led to arbitrary command execution. This issue is of moderate severity, since it requires the attacker to already be able to submit prompts to the agent (for instance through a prompt injection attack), for the user to have MCP enabled (on by default), and for the user to have enabled auto-approved file writes (off by default). Version 3.20.3 fixes the issue by adding an additional layer of opt-in configuration for auto-approving writing to Roo's configuration files, including all files within the `.roo/` folder.

<strong>Published : </strong> June 27, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 8 hours, 1 minute ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ESPAsyncWebServer is an asynchronous HTTP and WebSocket server library for ESP32, ESP8266, RP2040 and RP2350. In versions up to and including 3.7.8, a CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) injection vulnerability exists in the construction and output of HTTP headers within `AsyncWebHeader.cpp`. Unsanitized input allows attackers to inject CR (`\r`) or LF (`\n`) characters into header names or values, leading to arbitrary header or response manipulation. Manipulation of HTTP headers and responses can enable a wide range of attacks, making the severity of this vulnerability high. A fix is available at pull request 211 and is expected to be part of version 3.7.9.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>authentik is an open-source identity provider. After authorizing access to a RAC endpoint, authentik creates a token which is used for a single connection and is sent to the client in the URL. This token is intended to only be valid for the session of the user who authorized the connection, however this check is missing in versions prior to 2025.6.3 and 2025.4.3. When, for example, using RAC during a screenshare, a malicious user could access the same session by copying the URL from the shown browser. authentik 2025.4.3 and 2025.6.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, it is recommended to decrease the duration a token is valid for (in the RAC Provider settings, set Connection expiry to `minutes=5` for example). The maintainers of authentik also recommend enabling the option Delete authorization on disconnect.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53018
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 27, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 36 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Lychee is a free, open-source photo-management tool. Prior to version 6.6.13, a critical Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `/api/v2/Photo::fromUrl` endpoint. This flaw lets an attacker instruct the application’s backend to make HTTP requests to any URL they choose. Consequently, internal network resources—such as localhost services or cloud-provider metadata endpoints—become reachable. The endpoint takes a URL from the user and calls it server-side via fopen() without any safeguards. There is no IP address validation, nor are there any allow-list, timeout, or size restrictions. Because of this, attackers can point the application at internal targets. Using this flaw, an attacker can perform internal port scans or retrieve sensitive cloud metadata. Version 6.6.13 contains a patch for the issue.

À l’heure où le recrutement de spécialistes en matière de sécurité des systèmes d’information apparaît, de fait, essentiel, l’analyse du marché du travail réalisée dans cette 4<sup>e</sup> édition de l’Observatoire des métiers démontre que le nombre d’offres d’emploi disponibles a considérablement augmenté dans ce secteur.</p>
<p>Seulement, les employeurs continuent à rencontrer de grandes difficultés pour trouver des candidats, et ce, malgré le développement de nombreuses offres de formations pour répondre aux besoins du marché.</p>
<h3>Le rôle de l’Observatoire des métiers</h3>
<p>Afin de comprendre les raisons réelles de cette pénurie et d’identifier les leviers les plus pertinents qui pourraient permettre aux politiques publiques de lancer des initiatives capables de résoudre la situation, l’ANSSI, la Délégation générale à l’Emploi et à la Formation professionnelle (DGEFP) et l’Agence nationale pour la formation professionnelle des adultes (Afpa), recensent et collectent des indicateurs concernant les formations en cybersécurité ainsi que les offres d’emploi dans ce domaine, depuis 2021, via l’Observatoire des métiers.</p>
<h3>Les résultats de l’enquête 2025 réalisée auprès des professionnels de la cybersécurité</h3>
<p>En 2025, l’Observatoire des métiers a reconduit l’enquête menée en 2021 auprès des professionnels de la cybersécurité afin de réaliser une photographie générale de la population composant l’écosystème cyber français. L’objectif étant de mieux connaître certaines de leurs caractéristiques : parcours, profils, cadres d’exercices des missions et perspectives d’évolutions.</p>
<h4>Quelques chiffres clés</h4>

Cet événement a rassemblé 4 000 spécialistes en lutte offensive et cyberdéfense provenant de diverses organisations issues de 41 nations. La France s’est investie pleinement dans cet exercice avec la participation cette année encore des experts de l’ANSSI.</p>
<p>Locked Shields a mis à l’épreuve les compétences des participants et testé leurs capacités à répondre à un incident cyber de grande ampleur dans un environnement contrôlé et réaliste. Cet évènement est également une compétition entre les pays engagés qui permet aux experts en cybersécurité de se perfectionner dans la défense des systèmes d’information nationaux et des infrastructures critiques.</p>

<p>L’étude propose en effet un nouvel outil mathématique appelé <em>« syzygy distinguisher »</em>. Déjà utilisé en cryptographie, les distinguisher ont toutefois montré des limites face à certains problèmes complexes de cryptographie. Celui proposé par Hugues dans son papier offre des résultats considérablement supérieurs lorsqu’il s’agit de reconnaître des codes cryptographiques utilisés pour sécuriser les communications, notamment dans le cadre de la cryptographie post-quantique.</p>
<p>L’attribution de ce prix constitue une reconnaissance forte des travaux menés par Hugues Randriam et par l’ensemble du laboratoire de cryptographie de l’ANSSI. Elle souligne également l’engagement constant des équipes de l’Agence dans la recherche scientifique.</p>
<p>C’est une grande fierté pour l’ANSSI, non seulement pour le rayonnement de ses laboratoires, mais aussi pour le travail mené au quotidien par l’ensemble de ses agents.</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-texte-riche field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Avec 100 millions d’euros, le programme des parcours de cybersécurité a constitué un investissement sans précédent pour répondre à une menace devenue systémique, touchant des entités critiques au cœur des territoires.</p>
<p>Les « parcours de cybersécurité » avaient pour objectif d’élever la sécurité numérique des services publics, de dynamiser l’industrie de cybersécurité française et européenne et de favoriser des investissements durables au service de la cybersécurité des organisations.</p>
<p>Pendant 4 ans, l’ANSSI a conçu, déployé et piloté un dispositif d’accompagnement au profit des collectivités, des établissements de santé et des entités publiques. Ainsi, 945 entités parmi les plus vulnérables à la menace cyber ont pu bénéficier de cet accompagnement, dont :</p>
<ul><li>707 collectivités territoriales,</li>
<li>134 établissements de santé,</li>
<li>87 autres établissements publics,</li>
<li>17 centres de recherche et d’enseignement supérieur,</li>
</ul><p>Parmi celles-ci, 62 entités ont été accompagnées dans les territoires d’Outre-mer.</p>
<p>Les parcours ont permis d’élever le niveau de cyberdéfense des bénéficiaires de manière significative : en moyenne, les bénéficiaires sont passés d’un score de maturité cyber de D+ à B, soulignant un progrès conséquent. Grâce aux parcours, les entités ont réussi à s’intégrer dans l’écosystème cyber de leur territoire et de leur secteur, en lien avec l’ANSSI, et sont ainsi solidement ancrées dans une démarche de sécurisation à long terme.</p>
<p>Au-delà des bénéfices pour les entités accompagnées, les parcours de cybersécurité laissent un héritage exploitable dans la durée, notamment dans la perspective de la mise en œuvre de la directive NIS 2 avec la mise à disposition d’outils et de méthodes adaptés aux besoins de chaque bénéficiaire.</p>
<p>Le programme a permis de dynamiser l’offre industrielle de cybersécurité dans les territoires et de renforcer l’offre française et européenne de cybersécurité :</p>
<ul><li>197 prestataires présents sur l’ensemble du territoire national ont été impliqués.</li>
<li>40 millions d’euros ont été dédiés à l’acquisition de produits de cybersécurité français et européens (dont 33 millions d’euros pour des produits français).</li>
</ul><p>Les parcours de cybersécurité sont un succès, avec des effets tangibles et durables pour les bénéficiaires. Ils font partie d'un programme plus large de soutien à la transformation numérique et à la résilience des systèmes d'information, dans un contexte où les cybermenaces se multiplient.</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-texte-riche field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Les transports urbains constituent un secteur critique et les attaques informatiques qui le visent peuvent avoir des conséquences significatives qui génèrent parfois des difficultés dans la continuité des services ou encore dans la sécurisation des données. La menace à l’encontre des entités du secteur cible des entreprises de toute taille, dans le monde entier, et qui ont la gestion d’une large variété de moyen de transports. Répondant à ses missions de connaissance de la menace informatique, l’ANSSI partage un état de la menace sur le secteur du transport urbain.</p>
<h3><strong>Un secteur fortement exposé en 2024</strong></h3>
<p>Tout au long de l’année, le contexte des Jeux Olympiques et Paralympiques de Paris 2024 a mis en lumière l’exposition de ce secteur aux cyberattaques, les tensions géopolitiques ayant été un catalyseur fort de cette menace avec de nombreuses attaques par déni de services.</p>
<p>L’imbrication de plusieurs réseaux informatiques de grande taille ainsi que la diversité des équipements qui les composent met en exergue des niveaux de sécurisation hétérogène complexifiant d’autant plus les questions de sécurité des systèmes d’information et augmentant significativement la surface d’attaque.</p>
<p>Les entités du secteur sont également fortement ciblées en raison du grand nombre de données personnelles des usagers, ainsi une attention toute particulière doit être portée à la protection de ces bases de données qui font régulièrement l’objet d’attaques à des fins d’exfiltration.</p>
<h3><strong>Prévenir et se protéger contre ces menaces</strong></h3>
<p>Dans son état de la menace, l’ANSSI rappelle l’importance d’avoir une approche globale de la sécurité et recommande aux entités de réaliser une cartographie globale des systèmes d’information afin d’identifier les risques affectant l’entité ou encore mesurer la maturité des systèmes d’informations concernés.</p>
<p>Il est essentiel de travailler sur des modes de fonctionnement dégradé notamment pour assurer et préparer en parallèle un <strong>plan de continuité d’activité (PCA)</strong> et un <strong>plan de reprise d’activité (PRA)</strong>. La mise en pratique ces recommandations permettra au secteur des transports urbains d’anticiper ces menaces.</p>

<h3><strong>Les Jeux olympiques et paralympiques de Paris 2024 comme consécration du modèle français de cyberdéfense</strong></h3>
<p>En tant que cheffe de file du volet cyber, l’ANSSI a été au cœur de la préparation des Jeux olympiques et paralympiques de Paris 2024. Le succès de cet événement international majeur est un accomplissement pour l’Agence, qui témoigne également de la pertinence du modèle de cyberdéfense français bâti autour d’une autorité nationale et ancré dans un écosystème élargi et déployé dans les territoires. Les Jeux sont le résultat d’une méthode – anticipation, préparation, entraînement – et d’une équipe – l’écosystème cyber public et privé – qui doivent perdurer pour<strong> permettre à la France de rester parmi les grandes nations de la cybersécurité.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>La directive NIS 2, vecteur d’une transformation profonde pour l’ANSSI</strong></h3>
<p>En 2024, l’ANSSI a poursuivi ses travaux de transposition de la directive NIS 2 qui sont le moteur d’un changement majeur de son organisation, de ses méthodes et de sa manière d’interagir avec ses bénéficiaires et ses partenaires. Déjà fortement mobilisées sur le sujet au cours des dernières années, les équipes de l’Agence continueront de l’être au quotidien, en coordination avec l’écosystème cyber, pour accompagner des milliers d’entités dans leur cybersécurité.</p>
<h3><strong>Des progrès précieux pour l’élévation générale de la cybersécurité de l’Union européenne</strong></h3>
<p>À l’image du cadre réglementaire défini par NIS 2, ou encore du vote du règlement sur la résilience cyber, pour lesquels l’ANSSI s’est pleinement engagée, la cybersécurité en Europe a connu de belles avancées en 2024. Par ailleurs, face aux évolutions technologiques, et notamment aux technologies de rupture, la conservation d’une maîtrise souveraine des expertises techniques s’impose comme une mission essentielle de l’ANSSI.</p>
<h4><strong>L’année 2024 en quelques chiffres :</strong></h4>
<ul><li><strong>656 </strong>agents âgés en moyenne de <strong>36 </strong>ans, œuvrent au quotidien pour la cybersécurité de la Nation, au sein de l’ANSSI.</li>
<li><strong>4 386 (+15%)</strong> événements de sécurité traités par l’ANSSI, et <strong>1 361 (+18%)</strong> incidents ayant impliqué un acteur malveillant.</li>
<li><strong>68</strong> formations labellisées SecNumedu, <strong>1 696</strong> personnes formées au Centre de formation à la sécurité des systèmes d’information (CFSSI) et <strong>117 856</strong> attestations SecNumacadémie décernées.</li>
</ul><h4><strong>L’année 2024 en quelques dates clés :</strong></h4>
<p>Au-delà des JOP24 d’autres d’événements ont marqué l’année 2024 :</p>
<ul><li><strong>31 janvier</strong> : Adoption du schéma européen de certification de cybersécurité fondé sur des critères commun.</li>
<li><strong>10 mai </strong>: Entrée en vigueur du décret d’application de la loi de programmation militaire 2024-2030, permettant à l’ANSSI de mettre en œuvre l’ensemble des nouvelles capacités dont elle l’a dotée.</li>
<li><strong>9 juillet </strong>: Publications des recommandations de l’ANSSI pour l’hébergement des systèmes d’information sensible dans le cloud.</li>
<li><strong>15 octobre </strong>: Présentation en conseil des ministres du projet de loi relatif à la résilience des activités d’importance vitale, à la protection des infrastructures critiques à la cybersécurité et à la résilience opérationnelle du secteur financier dont le titre II, Cybersécurité, vise à transposer la directive NIS 2.</li>

          Cette année exceptionnelle ouvre désormais la voie à une nouvelle étape pour l’ANSSI, qui a été partagée dans notre stratégie pour 2025-2027 . Il s’agit de prendre acte des évolutions non seulement du paysage cyber, mais également de notre environnement plus global. Pour ce faire, nous aurons besoin de « l’équipe de France » de cybersécurité à nos côtes.
