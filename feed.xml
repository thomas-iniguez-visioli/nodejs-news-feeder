The issue exists in the subtitle download functionality, where user-controlled parameters are used to fetch remote content and construct file paths without proper validation. By supplying a crafted subtitle download URL and a path traversal sequence in the file name, an attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution. | Severity UNKNOWN          </description>

      <description>[[[[[[[The vulnerability affects Ignition SCADA applications where Python 
scripting is utilized for automation purposes. The vulnerability arises 
from the absence of proper security controls that restrict which Python 
libraries can be imported and executed within the scripting environment.
 The core issue lies in the Ignition service account having system 
permissions beyond what an Ignition privileged user requires. When an 
authenticated administrator uploads a malicious project file containing 
Python scripts with bind shell capabilities, the application executes 
these scripts with the same privileges as the Ignition Gateway process, 
which typically runs with SYSTEM-level permissions on Windows. 
Alternative code execution patterns could lead to similar results. | CVSS Score 6.4 (MEDIUM)</description>

      <description>[[[[[[[Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network via the mDNS/DNS-SD protocol suite. In versions up to and including 0.9-rc2, the simple protocol server ignores the documented client limit and accepts unlimited connections, allowing for easy local DoS. Although `CLIENTS_MAX` is defined, `server_work()` unconditionally `accept()`s and `client_new()` always appends the new client and increments `n_clients`. There is no check against the limit. When client cannot be accepted as a result of maximal socket number of avahi-daemon, it logs unconditionally error per each connection. Unprivileged local users can exhaust daemon memory and file descriptors, causing a denial of service system-wide for mDNS/DNS-SD. Exhausting local file descriptors causes increased system load caused by logging errors of each of request. Overloading prevents glibc calls using nss-mdns plugins to resolve `*.local.` names and link-local addresses. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available, but a candidate fix is available in pull request 808, and some workarounds are available. Simple clients are offered for nss-mdns package functionality. It is not possible to disable the unix socket `/run/avahi-daemon/socket`, but resolution requests received via DBus are not affected directly. Tools avahi-resolve, avahi-resolve-address and avahi-resolve-host-name are not affected, they use DBus interface. It is possible to change permissions of unix socket after avahi-daemon is started. But avahi-daemon does not provide any configuration for it. Additional access restrictions like SELinux can also prevent unwanted tools to access the socket and keep resolution working for trusted users. | CVSS Score 5.5 (MEDIUM)                </description>

usb typec ucsi fix use-after-free caused by uec->work

The delayed work uec->work is scheduled in gaokun_ucsi_probe()
but never properly canceled in gaokun_ucsi_remove(). This creates
use-after-free scenarios where the ucsi and gaokun_ucsi structure
are freed after ucsi_destroy() completes execution, while the
gaokun_ucsi_register_worker() might be either currently executing
or still pending in the work queue. The already-freed gaokun_ucsi
or ucsi structure may then be accessed.

Furthermore, the race window is 3 seconds, which is sufficiently
long to make this bug easily reproducible. The following is the

      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

scsi imm Fix use-after-free bug caused by unfinished delayed work

The delayed work item 'imm_tq' is initialized in imm_attach() and
scheduled via imm_queuecommand() for processing SCSI commands.  When the
IMM parallel port SCSI host adapter is detached through imm_detach(),
the imm_struct device instance is deallocated.

However, the delayed work might still be pending or executing
when imm_detach() is called, leading to use-after-free bugs
when the work function imm_interrupt() accesses the already
freed imm_struct memory.

The race condition can occur as follows

CPU 0(detach thread)   | CPU 1
                       | imm_queuecommand()
                       |   imm_queuecommand_lck()
imm_detach()           |     schedule_delayed_work()
  kfree(dev) //FREE    | imm_interrupt()
                       |   dev = container_of(...) //USE
                           dev-> //USE

Add disable_delayed_work_sync() in imm_detach() to guarantee proper

      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

net/sched sch_cake Fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop

In cake_drop(), qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is used to update the qlen
and backlog of the qdisc hierarchy. Its caller, cake_enqueue(), assumes
that the parent qdisc will enqueue the current packet. However, this
assumption breaks when cake_enqueue() returns NET_XMIT_CN the parent
qdisc stops enqueuing current packet, leaving the tree qlen/backlog
accounting inconsistent. This mismatch can lead to a NULL dereference
(e.g., when the parent Qdisc is qfq_qdisc).

This patch computes the qlen/backlog delta in a more robust way by
observing the difference before and after the series of cake_drop()
calls, and then compensates the qdisc tree accounting if cake_enqueue()
returns NET_XMIT_CN.

To ensure correct compensation when ACK thinning is enabled, a new
variable is introduced to keep qlen unchanged. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>

      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[A Stored HTML Injection vulnerability was discovered in the Time Machine Snapshot Diff functionality due to improper validation of network traffic data. An unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted network packets at two different times to inject HTML tags into asset attributes across two snapshots. Exploitation requires a victim to use the Time Machine Snapshot Diff feature on those specific snapshots and perform specific GUI actions, at which point the injected HTML renders in their browser, enabling phishing and open redirect attacks. Full XSS exploitation is prevented by input validation and Content Security Policy. Attack complexity is high due to multiple required conditions. | CVSS Score 4.7 (MEDIUM)                                                  </description>

      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[A flaw in the binding process of Govee’s cloud platform and devices allows a remote attacker to bind an existing, online Govee device to the attacker’s account, resulting in full control of the device and removal of the device from its legitimate owner’s account.
The server‑side API allows device association using a set of identifiers "device", "sku", "type", and a client‑computed "value", that are not cryptographically bound to a secret originating from the device itself.

The vulnerability has been verified for the Govee H6056 - lamp device in firmware version 1.08.13, but may affect also other Govee cloud‑connected devices. The vendor is not able to provide a list of affected products, but rolls out a firmware and server-side fixes. Devices that reached end‑of‑life for security support need replacement with newer models supporting updates. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>
