Versions 1.4.17 and below are subject to arbitrary code execution from cookie config. When dynamic cookies are enabled (e.g. there  an existing cookie schema), the cookie config is injected into the compiled route without first being sanitised. Availability of this exploit is generally low, but when combined with GHSA-hxj9-33pp-j2cc, it allows for a full RCE chain. An attack requires write access to either the Elysia app's source code (in which case the vulnerability is meaningless) or write access to the cookie config (perhaps where it is assumed to be provisioned by the environment).

Due to unsafe handling and deletion of temporary files in versions 10.0.0 through 13.12.0, during the dictionary upload process an attacker with access to the backoffice can trigger predictable requests to temporary file paths. The application’s error responses (HTTP 500 when a file exists, 404 when it does not) allow the attacker to enumerate the existence of arbitrary files on the server’s filesystem. This vulnerability does not allow reading or writing file contents.

Versions 2.40.0 and below contain symbolic links (symlinks) which can be used to access files or directories outside the intended web root folder. SWS generally does not prevent symlinks from escaping the web server’s root directory. Therefore, if a malicious actor gains access to the web server’s root directory, they could create symlinks to access other files outside the designated web root folder either by URL or via the directory listing.

riscv mm add missing memcpy in kasan_init

Hi Atish,

It seems that the panic is due to the missing memcpy during kasan_init.
Could you please check whether this patch is helpful?

When doing kasan_populate, the new allocated base_pud/base_p4d should
contain kasan_early_shadow_{pud, p4d}'s content. Add the missing memcpy
to avoid page fault when read/write kasan shadow region.

Tested on
 - qemu with sv57 and CONFIG_KASAN on.
 - qemu with sv48 and CONFIG_KASAN on. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

hwrng geode - Fix PCI device refcount leak

for_each_pci_dev() is implemented by pci_get_device(). The comment of
pci_get_device() says that it will increase the reference count for the
returned pci_dev and also decrease the reference count for the input
pci_dev @from if it is not NULL.

If we break for_each_pci_dev() loop with pdev not NULL, we need to call
pci_dev_put() to decrease the reference count. We add a new struct
'amd_geode_priv' to record pointer of the pci_dev and membase, and then
add missing pci_dev_put() for the normal and error path. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

wifi ipw2200 fix memory leak in ipw_wdev_init()

In the error path of ipw_wdev_init(), exception value is returned, and
the memory applied for in the function is not released. Also the memory
is not released in ipw_pci_probe(). As a result, memory leakage occurs.
So memory release needs to be added to the error path of ipw_wdev_init(). | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

seccomp Move copy_seccomp() to no failure path.

Our syzbot instance reported memory leaks in do_seccomp() [0], similar
to the report [1].  It shows that we miss freeing struct seccomp_filter
and some objects included in it.

We can reproduce the issue with the program below [2] which calls one
seccomp() and two clone() syscalls.

The first clone()d child exits earlier than its parent and sends a
signal to kill it during the second clone(), more precisely before the
fatal_signal_pending() test in copy_process().  When the parent receives
the signal, it has to destroy the embryonic process and return -EINTR to
user space.  In the failure path, we have to call seccomp_filter_release()
to decrement the filter's refcount.

Initially, we called it in free_task() called from the failure path, but
the commit 3a15fb6ed92c ("seccomp release filter after task is fully
dead") moved it to release_task() to notify user space as early as possible
that the filter is no longer used.

To keep the change and current seccomp refcount semantics, let's move
copy_seccomp() just after the signal check and add a WARN_ON_ONCE() in
free_task() for future debugging.

wifi ath11k fix failed to find the peer with peer_id 0 when disconnected

It has a fail log which is ath11k_dbg in ath11k_dp_rx_process_mon_status(),
as below, it will not print when debug_mask is not set ATH11K_DBG_DATA.
	ath11k_dbg(ab, ATH11K_DBG_DATA,
		  "failed to find the peer with peer_id %d\n",
		   ppdu_info.peer_id)

When run scan with station disconnected, the peer_id is 0 for case
HAL_RX_MPDU_START in ath11k_hal_rx_parse_mon_status_tlv() which called
from ath11k_dp_rx_process_mon_status(), and the peer_id of ppdu_info is
reset to 0 in the while loop, so it does not match condition of the
check "if (ppdu_info->peer_id == HAL_INVALID_PEERID" in the loop, and
then the log "failed to find the peer with peer_id 0" print after the
check in the loop, it is below call stack when debug_mask is set
ATH11K_DBG_DATA.

The reason is this commit 01d2f285e3e5 ("ath11k decode HE status tlv")
add "memset(ppdu_info, 0, sizeof(struct hal_rx_mon_ppdu_info))" in
ath11k_dp_rx_process_mon_status(), but the commit does not initialize
the peer_id to HAL_INVALID_PEERID, then lead the check mis-match.

ext4 fix deadlock due to mbcache entry corruption

When manipulating xattr blocks, we can deadlock infinitely looping
inside ext4_xattr_block_set() where we constantly keep finding xattr
block for reuse in mbcache but we are unable to reuse it because its
reference count is too big. This happens because cache entry for the
xattr block is marked as reusable (e_reusable set) although its
reference count is too big. When this inconsistency happens, this
inconsistent state is kept indefinitely and so ext4_xattr_block_set()
keeps retrying indefinitely.

The inconsistent state is caused by non-atomic update of e_reusable bit.
e_reusable is part of a bitfield and e_reusable update can race with
update of e_referenced bit in the same bitfield resulting in loss of one
of the updates. Fix the problem by using atomic bitops instead.

This bug has been around for many years, but it became *much* easier
to hit after commit 65f8b80053a1 ("ext4 fix race when reusing xattr
blocks"). | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

If device_register() fails, it has two issues
1. The name allocated by dev_set_name() is leaked.
2. The parent of device is not NULL, device_unregister() is called
   in zynqmp_ipi_free_mboxes(), it will lead a kernel crash because
   of removing not added device.

Call put_device() to give up the reference, so the name is freed in
kobject_cleanup(). Add device registered check in zynqmp_ipi_free_mboxes()
to avoid null-ptr-deref. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

This is because the mm->context.vdso_info is NULL in vfork case. From
another side, mm->context.vdso_info either points to vdso info
for RV64 or vdso info for compat, there's no need to bloat riscv's
mm_context_t, we can handle the difference when setup the additional
page for vdso. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

arm64 mte Avoid setting PG_mte_tagged if no tags cleared or restored

Prior to commit 69e3b846d8a7 ("arm64 mte Sync tags for pages where PTE
is untagged"), mte_sync_tags() was only called for pte_tagged() entries
(those mapped with PROT_MTE). Therefore mte_sync_tags() could safely use
test_and_set_bit(PG_mte_tagged, page->flags) without inadvertently
setting PG_mte_tagged on an untagged page.

The above commit was required as guests may enable MTE without any
control at the stage 2 mapping, nor a PROT_MTE mapping in the VMM.
However, the side-effect was that any page with a PTE that looked like
swap (or migration) was getting PG_mte_tagged set automatically. A
subsequent page copy (e.g. migration) copied the tags to the destination
page even if the tags were owned by KASAN.

This issue was masked by the page_kasan_tag_reset() call introduced in
commit e5b8d9218951 ("arm64 mte reset the page tag in page->flags").
When this commit was reverted (20794545c146), KASAN started reporting
access faults because the overriding tags in a page did not match the
original page->flags (with CONFIG_KASAN_HW_TAGS=y)

Move the PG_mte_tagged bit setting from mte_sync_tags() to the actual
place where tags are cleared (mte_sync_page_tags()) or restored
(mte_restore_tags()). | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

This was caused because of new buffers with different RX ring count should
substitute older ones, but those buffers were freed in
i40e_configure_rx_ring and reallocated again with i40e_alloc_rx_bi,
thus kfree on rx_bi caused leak of already mapped DMA.

Fix this by reallocating ZC with rx_bi_zc struct when BPF program loads. Additionally
reallocate back to rx_bi when BPF program unloads.

If BPF program is loaded/unloaded and XSK pools are created, reallocate
RX queues accordingly in XSP_SETUP_XSK_POOL handler. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

wifi ath11k Ignore frags from uninitialized peer in dp.

When max virtual ap interfaces are configured in all the bands with
ACS and hostapd restart is done every 60s, a crash is observed at
random times.
In this certain scenario, a fragmented packet is received for
self peer, for which rx_tid and rx_frags are not initialized in
datapath. While handling this fragment, crash is observed as the
rx_frag list is uninitialised and when we walk in
ath11k_dp_rx_h_sort_frags, skb null leads to exception.

To address this, before processing received fragments we check
dp_setup_done flag is set to ensure that peer has completed its
dp peer setup for fragment queue, else ignore processing the
fragments.

block/rq_qos protect rq_qos apis with a new lock

commit 50e34d78815e ("block disable the elevator int del_gendisk")
move rq_qos_exit() from disk_release() to del_gendisk(), this will
introduce some problems

1) If rq_qos_add() is triggered by enabling iocost/iolatency through
   cgroupfs, then it can concurrent with del_gendisk(), it's not safe to
   write 'q->rq_qos' concurrently.

2) Activate cgroup policy that is relied on rq_qos will call
   rq_qos_add() and blkcg_activate_policy(), and if rq_qos_exit() is
   called in the middle, null-ptr-dereference will be triggered in
   blkcg_activate_policy().

3) blkg_conf_open_bdev() can call blkdev_get_no_open() first to find the
   disk, then if rq_qos_exit() from del_gendisk() is done before
   rq_qos_add(), then memory will be leaked.

This patch add a new disk level mutex 'rq_qos_mutex'

1) The lock will protect rq_qos_exit() directly.

2) For wbt that doesn't relied on blk-cgroup, rq_qos_add() can only be
   called from disk initialization for now because wbt can't be
   destructed until rq_qos_exit(), so it's safe not to protect wbt for
   now. Hoever, in case that rq_qos dynamically destruction is supported
   in the furture, this patch also protect rq_qos_add() from wbt_init()
   directly, this is enough because blk-sysfs already synchronize
   writers with disk removal.

3) For iocost and iolatency, in order to synchronize disk removal and
   cgroup configuration, the lock is held after blkdev_get_no_open()
   from blkg_conf_open_bdev(), and is released in blkg_conf_exit().
   In order to fix the above memory leak, disk_live() is checked after
   holding the new lock. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

kcm Fix error handling for SOCK_DGRAM in kcm_sendmsg().

syzkaller found a memory leak in kcm_sendmsg(), and commit c821a88bd720
("kcm Fix memory leak in error path of kcm_sendmsg()") suppressed it by
updating kcm_tx_msg(head)->last_skb if partial data is copied so that the
following sendmsg() will resume from the skb.

However, we cannot know how many bytes were copied when we get the error.
Thus, we could mess up the MSG_MORE queue.

When kcm_sendmsg() fails for SOCK_DGRAM, we should purge the queue as we
do so for UDP by udp_flush_pending_frames().

Even without this change, when the error occurred, the following sendmsg()
resumed from a wrong skb and the queue was messed up.  However, we have
yet to get such a report, and only syzkaller stumbled on it.  So, this
can be changed safely.

Note this does not change SOCK_SEQPACKET behaviour. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

md/raid10 fix null-ptr-deref in raid10_sync_request

init_resync() inits mempool and sets conf->have_replacemnt at the beginning
of sync, close_sync() frees the mempool when sync is completed.

After [1] recovery might be skipped and init_resync() is called but
close_sync() is not. null-ptr-deref occurs with r10bio->dev[i].repl_bio.

The following is one way to reproduce the issue.

  1) create a array, wait for resync to complete, mddev->recovery_cp is set
     to MaxSector.
  2) recovery is woken and it is skipped. conf->have_replacement is set to
     0 in init_resync(). close_sync() not called.
  3) some io errors and rdev A is set to WantReplacement.
  4) a new device is added and set to A's replacement.
  5) recovery is woken, A have replacement, but conf->have_replacemnt is
     0. r10bio->dev[i].repl_bio will not be alloced and null-ptr-deref
     occurs.

Fix it by not calling init_resync() if recovery skipped.

drm/i915 Fix NULL ptr deref by checking new_crtc_state

intel_atomic_get_new_crtc_state can return NULL, unless crtc state wasn't
obtained previously with intel_atomic_get_crtc_state, so we must check it
for NULLness here, just as in many other places, where we can't guarantee
that intel_atomic_get_crtc_state was called.
We are currently getting NULL ptr deref because of that, so this fix was
confirmed to help.

      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

iio adc ina2xx avoid NULL pointer dereference on OF device match

The affected lines were resulting in a NULL pointer dereference on our
platform because the device tree contained the following list of
compatible strings

    power-sensor@40 {
        compatible = "ti,ina232", "ti,ina231"
        ...
    }

Since the driver doesn't declare a compatible string "ti,ina232", the OF
matching succeeds on "ti,ina231". But the I2C device ID info is
populated via the first compatible string, cf. modalias population in
of_i2c_get_board_info(). Since there is no "ina232" entry in the legacy
I2C device ID table either, the struct i2c_device_id *id pointer in the
probe function is NULL.

Fix this by using the already populated type variable instead, which
points to the proper driver data. Since the name is also wanted, add a
generic one to the ina2xx_config table. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

bpf, sockmap Fix skb refcnt race after locking changes

There is a race where skb's from the sk_psock_backlog can be referenced
after userspace side has already skb_consumed() the sk_buff and its refcnt
dropped to zer0 causing use after free.

The flow is the following

  while ((skb = skb_peek(psock->ingress_skb))
    sk_psock_handle_Skb(psock, skb, ..., ingress)
    if (!ingress) ...
    sk_psock_skb_ingress
       sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(skb)
          msg->skb = skb
          sk_psock_queue_msg(psock, msg)
    skb_dequeue(psock->ingress_skb)

The sk_psock_queue_msg() puts the msg on the ingress_msg queue. This is
what the application reads when recvmsg() is called. An application can
read this anytime after the msg is placed on the queue. The recvmsg hook
will also read msg->skb and then after user space reads the msg will call
consume_skb(skb) on it effectively free'ing it.

But, the race is in above where backlog queue still has a reference to
the skb and calls skb_dequeue(). If the skb_dequeue happens after the
user reads and free's the skb we have a use after free.

The !ingress case does not suffer from this problem because it uses
sendmsg_*(sk, msg) which does not pass the sk_buff further down the
stack.

The following splat was observed with 'test_progs -t sockmap_listen'

To fix we add an skb_get() before passing the skb to be enqueued in the
engress queue. This bumps the skb->users refcnt so that consume_skb()
and kfree_skb will not immediately free the sk_buff. With this we can
be sure the skb is still around when we do the dequeue. Then we just
need to decrement the refcnt or free the skb in the backlog case which
we do by calling kfree_skb() on the ingress case as well as the sendmsg
case.

Before locking change from fixes tag we had the sock locked so we
couldn't race with user and there was no issue here. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

net openvswitch reject negative ifindex

Recent changes in net-next (commit 759ab1edb56c ("net store netdevs
in an xarray")) refactored the handling of pre-assigned ifindexes
and let syzbot surface a latent problem in ovs. ovs does not validate
ifindex, making it possible to create netdev ports with negative
ifindex values. It's easy to repro with YNL

$ ./cli.py --spec netlink/specs/ovs_datapath.yaml \
         --do new \
	 --json '{"upcall-pid" 1, "name""my-dp"}'
$ ./cli.py --spec netlink/specs/ovs_vport.yaml \
	 --do new \
	 --json '{"upcall-pid" "00000001", "name" "some-port0", "dp-ifindex"3,"ifindex"4294901760,"type"2}'

$ ip link show

Validate the inputs. Now the second command correctly returns

nilfs2 fix infinite loop in nilfs_mdt_get_block()

If the disk image that nilfs2 mounts is corrupted and a virtual block
address obtained by block lookup for a metadata file is invalid,
nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level() may return the same internal return code as
-ENOENT, meaning the block does not exist in the metadata file.

This duplication of return codes confuses nilfs_mdt_get_block(), causing
it to read and create a metadata block indefinitely.

In particular, if this happens to the inode metadata file, ifile,
semaphore i_rwsem can be left held, causing task hangs in lock_mount.

Fix this issue by making nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level() treat virtual block
address translation failures with -ENOENT as metadata corruption instead
of returning the error code. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

The root cause is, inodeA references inodeB via inodeB's ino, once inodeA
is truncated, it calls truncate_dnode() to truncate data blocks in inodeB's
node page, it traverse mapping data from node->i.i_addr[0] to
node->i.i_addr[ADDRS_PER_BLOCK() - 1], result in out-of-boundary access.

This patch fixes to add sanity check on dnode page in truncate_dnode(),
so that, it can help to avoid triggering such issue, and once it encounters
such issue, it will record newly introduced ERROR_INVALID_NODE_REFERENCE
error into superblock, later fsck can detect such issue and try repairing.

Also, it removes f2fs_truncate_data_blocks() for cleanup due to the
function has only one caller, and uses f2fs_truncate_data_blocks_range()
instead. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

usb-storage alauda Fix uninit-value in alauda_check_media()

Syzbot got KMSAN to complain about access to an uninitialized value in
the alauda subdriver of usb-storage

The problem is that alauda_check_media() doesn't verify that its USB
transfer succeeded before trying to use the received data.  What
should happen if the transfer fails isn't entirely clear, but a
reasonably conservative approach is to pretend that no media is
present.

A similar problem exists in a usb_stor_dbg() call in
alauda_get_media_status().  In this case, when an error occurs the
call is redundant, because usb_stor_ctrl_transfer() already will print
a debugging message.

Finally, unrelated to the uninitialized memory access, is the fact
that alauda_check_media() performs DMA to a buffer on the stack.
Fortunately usb-storage provides a general purpose DMA-able buffer for
uses like this.  We'll use it instead. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

drm/msm/dp Drop aux devices together with DP controller

Using devres to depopulate the aux bus made sure that upon a probe
deferral the EDP panel device would be destroyed and recreated upon next
attempt.

But the struct device which the devres is tied to is the DPUs
(drm_dev->dev), which may be happen after the DP controller is torn
down.

Indications of this can be seen in the commonly seen EDID-hexdump full
of zeros in the log, or the occasional/rare KASAN fault where the
panel's attempt to read the EDID information causes a use after free on
DP resources.

It's tempting to move the devres to the DP controller's struct device,
but the resources used by the device(s) on the aux bus are explicitly
torn down in the error path. The KASAN-reported use-after-free also
remains, as the DP aux "module" explicitly frees its devres-allocated
memory in this code path.

As such, explicitly depopulate the aux bus in the error path, and in the
component unbind path, to avoid these issues.

ASoC mediatek mt8186 Fix use-after-free in driver remove path

When devm runs function in the "remove" path for a device it runs them
in the reverse order. That means that if you have parts of your driver
that aren't using devm or are using "roll your own" devm w/
devm_add_action_or_reset() you need to keep that in mind.

The mt8186 audio driver didn't quite get this right. Specifically, in
mt8186_init_clock() it called mt8186_audsys_clk_register() and then
went on to call a bunch of other devm function. The caller of
mt8186_init_clock() used devm_add_action_or_reset() to call
mt8186_deinit_clock() but, because of the intervening devm functions,
the order was wrong.

Specifically at probe time, the order was
1. mt8186_audsys_clk_register()
2. afe_priv->clk = devm_kcalloc(...)
3. afe_priv->clk[i] = devm_clk_get(...)

At remove time, the order (which should have been 3, 2, 1) was
1. mt8186_audsys_clk_unregister()
3. Free all of afe_priv->clk[i]
2. Free afe_priv->clk

The above seemed to be causing a use-after-free. Luckily, it's easy to
fix this by simply using devm more correctly. Let's move the
devm_add_action_or_reset() to the right place. In addition to fixing
the use-after-free, code inspection shows that this fixes a leak
(missing call to mt8186_audsys_clk_unregister()) that would have
happened if any of the syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle() calls in
mt8186_init_clock() had failed. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

default tagging protocol, and thus, not everyone who tests the unbinding
path may have switched to it beforehand. The default
felix_tag_npi_teardown() does not require rtnl_lock() to be held. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

of overlay Call of_changeset_init() early

When of_overlay_fdt_apply() fails, the changeset may be partially
applied, and the caller is still expected to call of_overlay_remove() to
clean up this partial state.

However, of_overlay_apply() calls of_resolve_phandles() before
init_overlay_changeset().  Hence if the overlay fails to apply due to an
unresolved symbol, the overlay_changeset.cset.entries list is still
uninitialized, and cleanup will crash with a NULL-pointer dereference in
overlay_removal_is_ok().

Fix this by moving the call to of_changeset_init() from
init_overlay_changeset() to of_overlay_fdt_apply(), where all other
early initialization is done. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

It complains about acquiring a local_lock while holding a raw_spin_lock.
It means it should not allocate memory while holding a raw_spin_lock
since it is not safe for RT.

raw_spin_lock is needed because bpf_local_storage supports tracing
context. In particular for task local storage, it is easy to
get a "current" task PTR_TO_BTF_ID in tracing bpf prog.
However, task (and cgroup) local storage has already been moved to
bpf mem allocator which can be used after raw_spin_lock.

The splat is for the sk storage. For sk (and inode) storage,
it has not been moved to bpf mem allocator. Using raw_spin_lock or not,
kzalloc(GFP_ATOMIC) could theoretically be unsafe in tracing context.
However, the local storage helper requires a verifier accepted
sk pointer (PTR_TO_BTF_ID), it is hypothetical if that (mean running
a bpf prog in a kzalloc unsafe context and also able to hold a verifier
accepted sk pointer) could happen.

This patch avoids kzalloc after raw_spin_lock to silent the splat.
There is an existing kzalloc before the raw_spin_lock. At that point,
a kzalloc is very likely required because a lookup has just been done
before. Thus, this patch always does the kzalloc before acq

dm don't attempt to queue IO under RCU protection

dm looks up the table for IO based on the request type, with an
assumption that if the request is marked REQ_NOWAIT, it's fine to
attempt to submit that IO while under RCU read lock protection. This
is not OK, as REQ_NOWAIT just means that we should not be sleeping
waiting on other IO, it does not mean that we can't potentially
schedule.

A simple test case demonstrates this quite nicely

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        struct iovec iov
        int fd

        fd = open("/dev/dm-0", O_RDONLY | O_DIRECT)

      (...)
  }

The warning happens because btrfs_qgroup_destroy_extent_records(), called
in the transaction abort path, we free all entries from the rbtree
"dirty_extent_root" with rbtree_postorder_for_each_entry_safe(), but we
don't actually empty the rbtree - it's still pointing to nodes that were
freed.

So set the rbtree's root node to NULL to avoid this warning (assign
RB_ROOT). | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>

ASoC soc-compress Reposition and add pcm_mutex

If panic_on_warn is set and compress stream(DPCM) is started,
then kernel panic occurred because card->pcm_mutex isn't held appropriately.
In the following functions, warning were issued at this line
"snd_soc_dpcm_mutex_assert_held".

static int dpcm_be_connect(struct snd_soc_pcm_runtime *fe,
		struct snd_soc_pcm_runtime *be, int stream)

	...
}

These functions are called by soc_compr_set_params_fe, soc_compr_open_fe
and soc_compr_free_fe
without pcm_mutex locking. And this is call stack.
