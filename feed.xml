<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/shmem, swap: fix softlockup with mTHP swapin

Following softlockup can be easily reproduced on my test machine with:

echo always > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/hugepages-64kB/enabled
swapon /dev/zram0 # zram0 is a 48G swap device
mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/test
echo 1G > /sys/fs/cgroup/test/memory.max
echo $BASHPID > /sys/fs/cgroup/test/cgroup.procs
while true; do
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/test.img bs=1M count=5120
    cat /tmp/test.img > /dev/null
    rm /tmp/test.img
done

Then after a while:

The reason is simple, readahead brought some order 0 folio in swap cache,
and the swapin mTHP folio being allocated is in conflict with it, so
swapcache_prepare fails and causes shmem_swap_alloc_folio to return
-EEXIST, and shmem simply retries again and again causing this loop.

Fix it by applying a similar fix for anon mTHP swapin.

The performance change is very slight, time of swapin 10g zero folios
with shmem (test for 12 times):
Before:  2.47s
After:   2.48s

      <title>CVE-2025-38242 - Linux Kernel Userfaultfd Swap Cache Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38242
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 15 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: userfaultfd: fix race of userfaultfd_move and swap cache

This commit fixes two kinds of races, they may have different results:

Barry reported a BUG_ON in commit c50f8e6053b0, we may see the same
BUG_ON if the filemap lookup returned NULL and folio is added to swap
cache after that.

If another kind of race is triggered (folio changed after lookup) we
may see RSS counter is corrupted:

[  406.893936] BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:ffff0000c5a9ddc0
type:MM_ANONPAGES val:-1
[  406.894071] BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:ffff0000c5a9ddc0
type:MM_SHMEMPAGES val:1

Because the folio is being accounted to the wrong VMA.

I'm not sure if there will be any data corruption though, seems no. 
The issues above are critical already.


On seeing a swap entry PTE, userfaultfd_move does a lockless swap cache
lookup, and tries to move the found folio to the faulting vma.  Currently,
it relies on checking the PTE value to ensure that the moved folio still
belongs to the src swap entry and that no new folio has been added to the
swap cache, which turns out to be unreliable.

While working and reviewing the swap table series with Barry, following
existing races are observed and reproduced [1]:

In the example below, move_pages_pte is moving src_pte to dst_pte, where
src_pte is a swap entry PTE holding swap entry S1, and S1 is not in the
swap cache:

CPU1                               CPU2
userfaultfd_move
  move_pages_pte()
    entry = pte_to_swp_entry(orig_src_pte);
    // Here it got entry = S1
    ... < interrupted> ...
                                   <swapin src_pte, alloc and use folio A>
                                   // folio A is a new allocated folio
                                   // and get installed into src_pte
                                   <frees swap entry S1>
                                   // src_pte now points to folio A, S1
                                   // has swap count == 0, it can be freed
                                   // by folio_swap_swap or swap
                                   // allocator's reclaim.
                                   <try to swap out another folio B>
                                   // folio B is a folio in another VMA.
                                   <put folio B to swap cache using S1 >
                                   // S1 is freed, folio B can use it
                                   // for swap out with no problem.
                                   ...
    folio = filemap_get_folio(S1)
    // Got folio B here !!!
    ... < interrupted again> ...
                                   <swapin folio B and free S1>
                                   // Now S1 is free to be used again.
                                   <swapout src_pte & folio A using S1>
                                   // Now src_pte is a swap entry PTE
                                   // holding S1 again.
    folio_trylock(folio)
    move_swap_pte
      double_pt_lock
      is_pte_pages_stable
      // Check passed because src_pte == S1
      folio_move_anon_rmap(...)
      // Moved invalid folio B here !!!

The race window is very short and requires multiple collisions of multiple
rare events, so it's very unlikely to happen, but with a deliberately
constructed reproducer and increased time window, it can be reproduced
easily.

This can be fixed by checking if the folio returned by filemap is the
valid swap cache folio after acquiring the folio lock.

Another similar race is possible: filemap_get_folio may return NULL, but
folio (A) could be swapped in and then swapped out again using the same
swap entry after the lookup.  In such a case, folio (A) may remain in the
swap cache, so it must be moved too:

CPU1                               CPU2
userfaultfd_move
  move_pages_pte()
    entry = pte_to_swp_entry(orig_src_pte);
    // Here it got entry = S1, and S1 is not in swap cache
    folio = filemap_get

      <title>CVE-2025-38243 - "Linux Btrfs Null Pointer Dereference Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38243
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 15 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix invalid inode pointer dereferences during log replay

In a few places where we call read_one_inode(), if we get a NULL pointer
we end up jumping into an error path, or fallthrough in case of
__add_inode_ref(), where we then do something like this:

   iput(&inode->vfs_inode);

which results in an invalid inode pointer that triggers an invalid memory
access, resulting in a crash.

Fix this by making sure we don't do such dereferences.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38245

<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 15 minutes ago

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

atm: Release atm_dev_mutex after removing procfs in atm_dev_deregister().

syzbot reported a warning below during atm_dev_register(). [0]

Before creating a new device and procfs/sysfs for it, atm_dev_register()
looks up a duplicated device by __atm_dev_lookup().  These operations are
done under atm_dev_mutex.

However, when removing a device in atm_dev_deregister(), it releases the
mutex just after removing the device from the list that __atm_dev_lookup()
iterates over.

So, there will be a small race window where the device does not exist on
the device list but procfs/sysfs are still not removed, triggering the
splat.

Let's hold the mutex until procfs/sysfs are removed in
atm_dev_deregister().

      <title>CVE-2025-38247 - "Linux Kernel User Namespace and Mnt Idmap Leak"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38247
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 15 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

userns and mnt_idmap leak in open_tree_attr(2)

Once want_mount_setattr() has returned a positive, it does require
finish_mount_kattr() to release ->mnt_userns.  Failing do_mount_setattr()
does not change that.

As the result, we can end up leaking userns and possibly mnt_idmap as
well.

      <title>CVE-2025-38248 - Linux Kernel Bridge Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38248
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 15 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration

The bridge maintains a global list of ports behind which a multicast
router resides. The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure
multicast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not
member in the matching MDB entry.

When per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast
context is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global
router port list:

 # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1
 # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy
 # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2
 $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router
 router ports on br1: dummy1
 # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1
 $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router

However, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN
multicast snooping is enabled:

 # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0
 # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2
 $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router
 router ports on br1: dummy1

Since commit 4b30ae9adb04 ("net: bridge: mcast: re-implement
br_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions"), when per-VLAN multicast
snooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the
per-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a
result, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it
is deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is
traversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):

 # ip link del dev dummy1
 # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy
 # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2

Similarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port
list. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}
contexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the
per-VLAN router port list:

 # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1
 # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy
 # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1
 # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1
 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2
 $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router
       router ports: dummy1
 # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0
 $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router

However, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when
per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:

 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0
 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2
 $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router
       router ports: dummy1

When the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast
context will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled
on the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router
port list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead
to a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new
port to the list, for example):

 # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy
 # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2
 # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1
 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2

Fix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or
per-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The
function is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast
context and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast
context.

Note that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only
takes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the
permanent one (2).

snd_usb_ctl_msg() is used directly for memory allocation without
validation. This length is controlled by the USB device.

The allocated buffer is cast to a uac3_cluster_header_descriptor
and its fields are accessed without verifying that the buffer
is large enough. If the device returns a smaller than expected
length, this leads to an out-of-bounds read.

Add a length check to ensure the buffer is large enough for
uac3_cluster_header_descriptor.

      <title>CVE-2025-38250 - "Bluetooth hci_core Use-After-Free Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38250
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 15 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_core: Fix use-after-free in vhci_flush()

syzbot reported use-after-free in vhci_flush() without repro. [0]

From the splat, a thread close()d a vhci file descriptor while
its device was being used by iotcl() on another thread.

Once the last fd refcnt is released, vhci_release() calls
hci_unregister_dev(), hci_free_dev(), and kfree() for struct
vhci_data, which is set to hci_dev->dev->driver_data.

The problem is that there is no synchronisation after unlinking
hdev from hci_dev_list in hci_unregister_dev().  There might be
another thread still accessing the hdev which was fetched before
the unlink operation.

We can use SRCU for such synchronisation.

Let's run hci_dev_reset() under SRCU and wait for its completion
in hci_unregister_dev().

Another option would be to restore hci_dev->destruct(), which was
removed in commit 587ae086f6e4 ("Bluetooth: Remove unused
hci-destruct cb").  However, this would not be a good solution, as
we should not run hci_unregister_dev() while there are in-flight
ioctl() requests, which could lead to another data-race KCSAN splat.

Note that other drivers seem to have the same problem, for exmaple,
virtbt_remove().

      <title>CVE-2025-38252 - Linux Kernel CXL Driver - Unvalidated Assumption Handler</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38252
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 15 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl/ras: Fix CPER handler device confusion

By inspection, cxl_cper_handle_prot_err() is making a series of fragile
assumptions that can lead to crashes:

1/ It assumes that endpoints identified in the record are a CXL-type-3
   device, nothing guarantees that.

2/ It assumes that the device is bound to the cxl_pci driver, nothing
   guarantees that.

3/ Minor, it holds the device lock over the switch-port tracing for no
   reason as the trace is 100% generated from data in the record.

Correct those by checking that the PCIe endpoint parents a cxl_memdev
before assuming the format of the driver data, and move the lock to where
it is required. Consequently this also makes the implementation ready for
CXL accelerators that are not bound to cxl_pci.

      <title>CVE-2025-38253 - Wacom HID Linux Kernel Crash Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38253
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 15 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: wacom: fix crash in wacom_aes_battery_handler()

Commit fd2a9b29dc9c ("HID: wacom: Remove AES power_supply after extended
inactivity") introduced wacom_aes_battery_handler() which is scheduled
as a delayed work (aes_battery_work).

In wacom_remove(), aes_battery_work is not canceled. Consequently, if
the device is removed while aes_battery_work is still pending, then hard
crashes or "Oops: general protection fault..." are experienced when
wacom_aes_battery_handler() is finally called. E.g., this happens with
built-in USB devices after resume from hibernate when aes_battery_work
was still pending at the time of hibernation.

So, take care to cancel aes_battery_work in wacom_remove().

      <title>CVE-2025-38254 - AMD Linux Kernel EDID Handling Buffer Overflow</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38254
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 15 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Add sanity checks for drm_edid_raw()

When EDID is retrieved via drm_edid_raw(), it doesn't guarantee to
return proper EDID bytes the caller wants: it may be either NULL (that
leads to an Oops) or with too long bytes over the fixed size raw_edid
array (that may lead to memory corruption).  The latter was reported
actually when connected with a bad adapter.

Add sanity checks for drm_edid_raw() to address the above corner
cases, and return EDID_BAD_INPUT accordingly.

(cherry picked from commit 648d3f4d209725d51900d6a3ed46b7b600140cdf)

return NULL directly if numgrps is zero.

We can pin a tail page of a folio, but then io_uring will try to unpin
the head page of the folio. While it should be fine in terms of keeping
the page actually alive, mm folks say it's wrong and triggers a debug
warning. Use unpin_user_folio() instead of unpin_user_page*.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38257
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 15 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/pkey: Prevent overflow in size calculation for memdup_user()

Number of apqn target list entries contained in 'nr_apqns' variable is
determined by userspace via an ioctl call so the result of the product in
calculation of size passed to memdup_user() may overflow.

In this case the actual size of the allocated area and the value
describing it won't be in sync leading to various types of unpredictable
behaviour later.

Use a proper memdup_array_user() helper which returns an error if an
overflow is detected. Note that it is different from when nr_apqns is
initially zero - that case is considered valid and should be handled in
subsequent pkey_handler implementations.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Driver gets and enables all regulator supplies in probe path
(wcd9335_parse_dt() and wcd9335_power_on_reset()), but does not cleanup
in final error paths and in unbind (missing remove() callback).  This
leads to leaked memory and unbalanced regulator enable count during
probe errors or unbind.

Fix this by converting entire code into devm_regulator_bulk_get_enable()
which also greatly simplifies the code.

[CAUSE]
Firstly the fs has a corrupted csum tree root, thus to mount the fs we
have to go "ro,rescue=ibadroots" mount option.

Normally with that mount option, a bad csum tree root should set
BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS flag, so that any future data read will
ignore csum search.

But in this particular case, we have the following call trace that
caused NULL csum root, but not setting BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS:

load_global_roots_objectid():

		ret = btrfs_search_slot();
		/* Succeeded */
		btrfs_item_key_to_cpu()
		found = true;
		/* We found the root item for csum tree. */
		root = read_tree_root_path();
		if (IS_ERR(root)) {
			if (!btrfs_test_opt(fs_info, IGNOREBADROOTS))
			/*
			 * Since we have rescue=ibadroots mount option,
			 * @ret is still 0.
			 */
			break;
	if (!found || ret) {
		/* @found is true, @ret is 0, error handling for csum
		 * tree is skipped.
		 */
	}

This means we completely skipped to set BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS if
the csum tree is corrupted, which results unexpected later csum lookup.

[FIX]
If read_tree_root_path() failed, always populate @ret to the error
number.

As at the end of the function, we need @ret to determine if we need to
do the extra error handling for csum tree.

      <title>CVE-2025-38261 - Linux RISC-V SR_SUM Status Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38261
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 15 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: save the SR_SUM status over switches

When threads/tasks are switched we need to ensure the old execution's
SR_SUM state is saved and the new thread has the old SR_SUM state
restored.

The issue was seen under heavy load especially with the syz-stress tool
running, with crashes as follows in schedule_tail:

Unable to handle kernel access to user memory without uaccess routines

---[ end trace b5f8f9231dc87dda ]---

The issue comes from the put_user() in schedule_tail
(kernel/sched/core.c) doing the following:

asmlinkage __visible void schedule_tail(struct task_struct *prev)
{
...
        if (current->set_child_tid)
                put_user(task_pid_vnr(current), current->set_child_tid);
...
}

the put_user() macro causes the code sequence to come out as follows:

1:	__enable_user_access()
2:	reg = task_pid_vnr(current);
3:	*current->set_child_tid = reg;
4:	__disable_user_access()

The problem is that we may have a sleeping function as argument which
could clear SR_SUM causing the panic above. This was fixed by
evaluating the argument of the put_user() macro outside the user-enabled
section in commit 285a76bb2cf5 ("riscv: evaluate put_user() arg before
enabling user access")"

In order for riscv to take advantage of unsafe_get/put_XXX() macros and
to avoid the same issue we had with put_user() and sleeping functions we
must ensure code flow can go through switch_to() from within a region of
code with SR_SUM enabled and come back with SR_SUM still enabled. This
patch addresses the problem allowing future work to enable full use of
unsafe_get/put_XXX() macros without needing to take a CSR bit flip cost
on every access. Make switch_to() save and restore SR_SUM.

      <title>CVE-2025-38262 - Linux UARTlite Concurrency Race Null Pointer Dereference</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38262
<br>

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: serial: uartlite: register uart driver in init

When two instances of uart devices are probing, a concurrency race can
occur. If one thread calls uart_register_driver function, which first
allocates and assigns memory to 'uart_state' member of uart_driver
structure, the other instance can bypass uart driver registration and
call ulite_assign. This calls uart_add_one_port, which expects the uart
driver to be fully initialized. This leads to a kernel panic due to a
null pointer dereference:

To prevent it, move uart driver registration in to init function. This
will ensure that uart_driver is always registered when probe function
is called.

      <title>CVE-2025-34077 - WordPress Pie Register Plugin Authentication Bypass and Remote Code Execution</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34077
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the WordPress Pie Register plugin ≤ 3.7.1.4 that allows unauthenticated attackers to impersonate arbitrary users by submitting a crafted POST request to the login endpoint. By setting social_site=true and manipulating the user_id_social_site parameter, an attacker can generate a valid WordPress session cookie for any user ID, including administrators. Once authenticated, the attacker may exploit plugin upload functionality to install a malicious plugin containing arbitrary PHP code, resulting in remote code execution on the underlying server.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34083
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unrestricted file upload vulnerability exists in the WordPress AIT CSV Import/Export plugin ≤ 3.0.3. The plugin exposes an upload handler at upload-handler.php that allows arbitrary file upload via a multipart/form-data POST request. This endpoint does not enforce authentication or content-type validation, enabling attackers to upload malicious PHP code directly to the server. Although the upload may produce an error related to CSV parsing, the malicious file is still saved under wp-content/uploads/ and remains executable. Notably, the plugin does not need to be active for exploitation to succeed.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34084
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unauthenticated information disclosure vulnerability exists in the WordPress Total Upkeep plugin (also known as BoldGrid Backup) prior to version 1.14.10. The plugin exposes multiple endpoints that allow unauthenticated users to retrieve detailed server configuration (env-info.php) and discover backup metadata (restore-info.json). These backups, which may include full SQL database dumps, are accessible without authentication if their paths are known or guessed. The restore-info.json endpoint discloses the absolute filesystem path of the latest backup, which attackers can convert into a web-accessible URL under wp-content/uploads/ and download. Extracting the database archive may yield credential hashes from the wp_users table, facilitating offline password cracking or credential stuffing attacks.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34085
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the WordPress Simple File List plugin prior to version 4.2.3 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to achieve remote code execution. The plugin's upload endpoint (ee-upload-engine.php) restricts file uploads based on extension, but lacks proper validation after file renaming. An attacker can first upload a PHP payload disguised as a .png file, then use the plugin’s ee-file-engine.php rename functionality to change the extension to .php. This bypasses upload restrictions and results in the uploaded payload being executable on the server.

      <title>CVE-2025-53547 - Helm Chart File Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53547
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 14 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Prior to 3.18.4, a specially crafted Chart.yaml file along with a specially linked Chart.lock file can lead to local code execution when dependencies are updated. Fields in a Chart.yaml file, that are carried over to a Chart.lock file when dependencies are updated and this file is written, can be crafted in a way that can cause execution if that same content were in a file that is executed (e.g., a bash.rc file or shell script). If the Chart.lock file is symlinked to one of these files updating dependencies will write the lock file content to the symlinked file. This can lead to unwanted execution. Helm warns of the symlinked file but did not stop execution due to symlinking. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.18.4.

      <title>CVE-2025-48384 - Git Symlink Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48384
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-48385 - Git Bundle Protocol Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48385
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When cloning a repository Git knows to optionally fetch a bundle advertised by the remote server, which allows the server-side to offload parts of the clone to a CDN. The Git client does not perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles, which allows the remote side to perform protocol injection. This protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched bundle to a location controlled by the adversary. The fetched content is fully controlled by the server, which can in the worst case lead to arbitrary code execution. The use of bundle URIs is not enabled by default and can be controlled by the bundle.heuristic config option. Some cases of the vulnerability require that the adversary is in control of where a repository will be cloned to. This either requires social engineering or a recursive clone with submodules. These cases can thus be avoided by disabling recursive clones. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48386
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. The wincred credential helper uses a static buffer (target) as a unique key for storing and comparing against internal storage. This credential helper does not properly bounds check the available space remaining in the buffer before appending to it with wcsncat(), leading to potential buffer overflows. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53372
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>node-code-sandbox-mcp is a Node.js–based Model Context Protocol server that spins up disposable Docker containers to execute arbitrary JavaScript. Prior to 1.3.0, a command injection vulnerability exists in the node-code-sandbox-mcp MCP Server. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to child_process.execSync, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges on the host machine, bypassing the sandbox protection of running code inside docker. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.3.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-38236 - Linux Unix af_unix Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38236
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 3 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Don't leave consecutive consumed OOB skbs.

Jann Horn reported a use-after-free in unix_stream_read_generic().

The following sequences reproduce the issue:

  $ python3
  from socket import *
  s1, s2 = socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM)
  s1.send(b'x', MSG_OOB)
  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb
  s1.send(b'y', MSG_OOB)
  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb
  s1.send(b'z', MSG_OOB)
  s2.recv(1)              # recv 'z' illegally
  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # access 'z' skb (use-after-free)

Even though a user reads OOB data, the skb holding the data stays on
the recv queue to mark the OOB boundary and break the next recv().

After the last send() in the scenario above, the sk2's recv queue has
2 leading consumed OOB skbs and 1 real OOB skb.

Then, the following happens during the next recv() without MSG_OOB

  1. unix_stream_read_generic() peeks the first consumed OOB skb
  2. manage_oob() returns the next consumed OOB skb
  3. unix_stream_read_generic() fetches the next not-yet-consumed OOB skb
  4. unix_stream_read_generic() reads and frees the OOB skb

, and the last recv(MSG_OOB) triggers KASAN splat.

The 3. above occurs because of the SO_PEEK_OFF code, which does not
expect unix_skb_len(skb) to be 0, but this is true for such consumed
OOB skbs.

  while (skip >= unix_skb_len(skb)) {
    skip -= unix_skb_len(skb);
    skb = skb_peek_next(skb, &sk->sk_receive_queue);
    ...
  }

In addition to this use-after-free, there is another issue that
ioctl(SIOCATMARK) does not function properly with consecutive consumed
OOB skbs.

So, nothing good comes out of such a situation.

Instead of complicating manage_oob(), ioctl() handling, and the next
ECONNRESET fix by introducing a loop for consecutive consumed OOB skbs,
let's not leave such consecutive OOB unnecessarily.

Now, while receiving an OOB skb in unix_stream_recv_urg(), if its
previous skb is a consumed OOB skb, it is freed.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-20325
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 54 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.4.3, 9.3.5, 9.2.7, and 9.1.10, and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.3.2411.103, 9.3.2408.113, and 9.2.2406.119, the software potentially exposes the search head cluster [splunk.secret](https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/administer/manage-users-and-security/9.4/install-splunk-enterprise-securely/deploy-secure-passwords-across-multiple-servers) key. This exposure could happen if you have a Search Head cluster and you configure the Splunk Enterprise `SHCConfig` log channel at the DEBUG logging level in the clustered deployment. <br><br>The vulnerability would require either local access to the log files or administrative access to internal indexes, which by default only the admin role receives. Review roles and capabilities on your instance and restrict internal index access to administrator-level roles. <br><br>See [Define roles on the Splunk platform with capabilities](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/Rolesandcapabilities), [Deploy a search head cluster](https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/administer/distributed-search/9.4/deploy-search-head-clustering/deploy-a-search-head-cluster), [Deploy secure passwords across multiple servers](https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/administer/manage-users-and-security/9.4/install-splunk-enterprise-securely/deploy-secure-passwords-across-multiple-servers) and [Set a security key for the search head cluster](https://help.splunk.com/splunk-enterprise/administer/distributed-search/9.4/configure-search-head-clustering/set-a-security-key-for-the-search-head-cluster#id_2c54937a_736c_47b5_9485_67e9e390acfa__Set_a_security_key_for_the_search_head_cluster)  for more information.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-20320
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 38 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.4.3, 9.3.5, 9.2.7 and 9.1.10, and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.3.2411.107, 9.3.2408.117, and 9.2.2406.121, a low-privileged user that does not hold the "admin" or "power" Splunk roles could craft a malicious payload through the `User Interface - Views` configuration page that could potentially lead to a denial of service (DoS).The user could cause the DoS by exploiting a path traversal vulnerability that allows for deletion of arbitrary files within a Splunk directory. The vulnerability requires the low-privileged user to phish the administrator-level victim by tricking them into initiating a request within their browser. The low-privileged user should not be able to exploit the vulnerability at will.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53530
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>WeGIA is a web manager for charitable institutions. The Wegia server has a vulnerability that allows excessively long HTTP GET requests to a specific URL. This issue arises from the lack of validation for the length of the errorstr parameter. Tests confirmed that the server processes URLs up to 8,142 characters, resulting in high resource consumption, elevated latency, timeouts, and read errors. This makes the server susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.  This vulnerability is fixed in 3.3.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-53531 - Wegia Web Manager Long GET Request Denial of Service Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53531
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>WeGIA is a web manager for charitable institutions. The Wegia server has a vulnerability that allows excessively long HTTP GET requests to a specific URL. This issue arises from the lack of validation for the length of the fid parameter. Tests confirmed that the server processes URLs up to 8,142 characters, resulting in high resource consumption, elevated latency, timeouts, and read errors. This makes the server susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.3.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-32023 - Redis Heap Out-of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32023
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 38 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. From 2.8 to before 8.0.3, 7.4.5, 7.2.10, and 6.2.19, an authenticated user may use a specially crafted string to trigger a stack/heap out of bounds write on hyperloglog operations, potentially leading to remote code execution. The bug likely affects all Redis versions with hyperloglog operations implemented. This vulnerability is fixed in 8.0.3, 7.4.5, 7.2.10, and 6.2.19. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing hyperloglog operations. This can be done using ACL to restrict HLL commands.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3262
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the huggingface/transformers repository, specifically in version 4.49.0. The vulnerability is due to inefficient regular expression complexity in the `SETTING_RE` variable within the `transformers/commands/chat.py` file. The regex contains repetition groups and non-optimized quantifiers, leading to exponential backtracking when processing 'almost matching' payloads. This can degrade application performance and potentially result in a denial-of-service (DoS) when handling specially crafted input strings. The issue is fixed in version 4.51.0.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3264
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically in the `get_imports()` function within `dynamic_module_utils.py`. This vulnerability affects versions 4.49.0 and is fixed in version 4.51.0. The issue arises from a regular expression pattern `\s*try\s*:.*?except.*?:` used to filter out try/except blocks from Python code, which can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption through crafted input strings due to catastrophic backtracking. This vulnerability can lead to remote code loading disruption, resource exhaustion in model serving, supply chain attack vectors, and development pipeline disruption.

      <title>CVE-2025-5472 - Llama Index JSONReader Stack Overflow Denial of Service Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-5472
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The JSONReader in run-llama/llama_index versions 0.12.28 is vulnerable to a stack overflow due to uncontrolled recursive JSON parsing. This vulnerability allows attackers to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) by submitting deeply nested JSON structures, leading to a RecursionError and crashing applications. The root cause is the unsafe recursive traversal design and lack of depth validation, which makes the JSONReader susceptible to stack overflow when processing deeply nested JSON. This impacts the availability of services, making them unreliable and disrupting workflows. The issue is resolved in version 0.12.38.

      <title>CVE-2025-6386 - Apache Parisneo Timing Attack in Lollms Authentication</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6386
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The parisneo/lollms repository is affected by a timing attack vulnerability in the `authenticate_user` function within the `lollms_authentication.py` file. This vulnerability allows attackers to enumerate valid usernames and guess passwords incrementally by analyzing response time differences. The affected version is the latest, and the issue is resolved in version 20.1. The vulnerability arises from the use of Python's default string equality operator for password comparison, which compares characters sequentially and exits on the first mismatch, leading to variable response times based on the number of matching initial characters.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3108
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 6, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 58 minutes ago

<strong>Description : </strong>A critical deserialization vulnerability exists in the run-llama/llama_index library's JsonPickleSerializer component, affecting versions v0.12.27 through v0.12.40. This vulnerability allows remote code execution due to an insecure fallback to Python's pickle module.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38235
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 6, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 13 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: appletb-kbd: fix "appletb_backlight" backlight device reference counting

During appletb_kbd_probe, probe attempts to get the backlight device
by name. When this happens backlight_device_get_by_name looks for a
device in the backlight class which has name "appletb_backlight" and
upon finding a match it increments the reference count for the device
and returns it to the caller. However this reference is never released
leading to a reference leak.

Fix this by decrementing the backlight device reference count on removal
via put_device and on probe failure.

      <title>CVE-2025-48952 - NetAlertX SHA-256 Magic Hash Login Bypass Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48952
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 22 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>NetAlertX is a network, presence scanner, and alert framework. Prior to version 25.6.7, a vulnerability in the authentication logic allows users to bypass password verification using SHA-256 magic hashes, due to loose comparison in PHP. In vulnerable versions of the application, a password comparison is performed using the `==` operator at line 40 in front/index.php. This introduces a security issue where specially crafted "magic hash" values that evaluate to true in a loose comparison can bypass authentication. Because of the use of `==` instead of the strict `===`, different strings that begin with 0e and are followed by only digits can be interpreted as scientific notation (i.e., zero) and treated as equal. This issue falls under the Login Bypass vulnerability class. Users with certain "weird" passwords that produce magic hashes are particularly affected. Services relying on this logic are at risk of unauthorized access. Version 25.6.7 fixes the vulnerability.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53365
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 23 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The MCP Python SDK, called `mcp` on PyPI, is a Python implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Prior to version 1.10.0, if a client deliberately triggers an exception after establishing a streamable HTTP session, this can lead to an uncaught ClosedResourceError on the server side, causing the server to crash and requiring a restart to restore service. Impact may vary depending on the deployment conditions, and presence of infrastructure-level resilience measures. Version 1.10.0 contains a patch for the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-49601 - MbedTLS LMS Public Key Buffer Out-of-Bounds Read</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-49601
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 16 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In MbedTLS 3.3.0 before 3.6.4, mbedtls_lms_import_public_key does not check that the input buffer is at least 4 bytes before reading a 32-bit field, allowing a possible out-of-bounds read on truncated input. Specifically, an out-of-bounds read in mbedtls_lms_import_public_key allows context-dependent attackers to trigger a crash or limited adjacent-memory disclosure by supplying a truncated LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature) public-key buffer under four bytes. An LMS public key starts with a 4-byte type indicator. The function mbedtls_lms_import_public_key reads this type indicator before validating the size of its input.

      <title>CVE-2025-49600 - MbedTLS LMS Signature Forgery Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-49600
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 12 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In MbedTLS 3.3.0 before 3.6.4, mbedtls_lms_verify may accept invalid signatures if hash computation fails and internal errors go unchecked, enabling LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature) forgery in a fault scenario. Specifically, unchecked return values in mbedtls_lms_verify allow an attacker (who can induce a hardware hash accelerator fault) to bypass LMS signature verification by reusing stale stack data, resulting in acceptance of an invalid signature. In mbedtls_lms_verify, the return values of the internal Merkle tree functions create_merkle_leaf_value and create_merkle_internal_value are not checked. These functions return an integer that indicates whether the call succeeded or not. If a failure occurs, the output buffer (Tc_candidate_root_node) may remain uninitialized, and the result of the signature verification is unpredictable. When the software implementation of SHA-256 is used, these functions will not fail. However, with hardware-accelerated hashing, an attacker could use fault injection against the accelerator to bypass verification.

      <title>CVE-2025-38234 - Linux Kernel Sched/rt: Push Rt Task Race Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38234
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/rt: Fix race in push_rt_task

Overview
========
When a CPU chooses to call push_rt_task and picks a task to push to
another CPU's runqueue then it will call find_lock_lowest_rq method
which would take a double lock on both CPUs' runqueues. If one of the
locks aren't readily available, it may lead to dropping the current
runqueue lock and reacquiring both the locks at once. During this window
it is possible that the task is already migrated and is running on some
other CPU. These cases are already handled. However, if the task is
migrated and has already been executed and another CPU is now trying to
wake it up (ttwu) such that it is queued again on the runqeue
(on_rq is 1) and also if the task was run by the same CPU, then the
current checks will pass even though the task was migrated out and is no
longer in the pushable tasks list.

Crashes
=======
This bug resulted in quite a few flavors of crashes triggering kernel
panics with various crash signatures such as assert failures, page
faults, null pointer dereferences, and queue corruption errors all
coming from scheduler itself.

Some of the crashes:

      <title>CVE-2025-46733 - OP-TEE Secure Storage API Panic Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46733
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>OP-TEE is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) designed as companion to a non-secure Linux kernel running on Arm; Cortex-A cores using the TrustZone technology. In version 4.5.0, using a specially crafted tee-supplicant binary running in REE userspace, an attacker can trigger a panic in a TA that uses the libutee Secure Storage API. Many functions in libutee, specifically those which make up the Secure Storage API, will panic if a system call returns an unexpected return code. This behavior is mandated by the TEE Internal Core API specification. However, in OP-TEE’s implementation, return codes of secure storage operations are passed through unsanitized from the REE tee-supplicant, through the Linux kernel tee-driver, through the OP-TEE kernel, back to libutee. Thus, an attacker with access to REE userspace, and the ability to stop tee-supplicant and replace it with their own process (generally trivial for a root user, and depending on the way permissions are set up, potentially available even to less privileged users) can run a malicious tee-supplicant process that responds to storage requests with unexpected response codes, triggering a panic in the requesting TA. This is particularly dangerous for TAs built with `TA_FLAG_SINGLE_INSTANCE` (corresponding to `gpd.ta.singleInstance` and `TA_FLAG_INSTANCE_KEEP_ALIVE` (corresponding to `gpd.ta.keepAlive`). The behavior of these TAs may depend on memory that is preserved between sessions, and the ability of an attacker to panic the TA and reload it with a clean memory space can compromise the behavior of those TAs. A critical example of this is the optee_ftpm TA. It uses the kept alive memory to hold PCR values, which crucially must be non-resettable. An attacker who can trigger a panic in the fTPM TA can reset the PCRs, and then extend them PCRs with whatever they choose, falsifying boot measurements, accessing sealed data, and potentially more. The impact of this issue depends significantly on the behavior of affected TAs. For some, it could manifest as a denial of service, while for others, like the fTPM TA, it can result in the disclosure of sensitive data. Anyone running the fTPM TA is affected, but similar attacks may be possible on other TAs that leverage the Secure Storage API. A fix is available in commit 941a58d78c99c4754fbd4ec3079ec9e1d596af8f.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38229
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: cxusb: no longer judge rbuf when the write fails

syzbot reported a uninit-value in cxusb_i2c_xfer. [1]

Only when the write operation of usb_bulk_msg() in dvb_usb_generic_rw()
succeeds and rlen is greater than 0, the read operation of usb_bulk_msg()
will be executed to read rlen bytes of data from the dvb device into the
rbuf.

In this case, although rlen is 1, the write operation failed which resulted
in the dvb read operation not being executed, and ultimately variable i was
not initialized.

      <title>CVE-2025-38230 - Linux JFS Shift Out of Bounds Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38230
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: validate AG parameters in dbMount() to prevent crashes

Validate db_agheight, db_agwidth, and db_agstart in dbMount to catch
corrupted metadata early and avoid undefined behavior in dbAllocAG.
Limits are derived from L2LPERCTL, LPERCTL/MAXAG, and CTLTREESIZE:

- agheight: 0 to L2LPERCTL/2 (0 to 5) ensures shift
  (L2LPERCTL - 2*agheight) >= 0.
- agwidth: 1 to min(LPERCTL/MAXAG, 2^(L2LPERCTL - 2*agheight))
  ensures agperlev >= 1.
  - Ranges: 1-8 (agheight 0-3), 1-4 (agheight 4), 1 (agheight 5).
  - LPERCTL/MAXAG = 1024/128 = 8 limits leaves per AG;
    2^(10 - 2*agheight) prevents division to 0.
- agstart: 0 to CTLTREESIZE-1 - agwidth*(MAXAG-1) keeps ti within
  stree (size 1365).
  - Ranges: 0-1237 (agwidth 1), 0-348 (agwidth 8).

      <title>CVE-2025-38231 - Linux Kernel NFSd NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38231
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: Initialize ssc before laundromat_work to prevent NULL dereference

In nfs4_state_start_net(), laundromat_work may access nfsd_ssc through
nfs4_laundromat -> nfsd4_ssc_expire_umount. If nfsd_ssc isn't initialized,
this can cause NULL pointer dereference.

Normally the delayed start of laundromat_work allows sufficient time for
nfsd_ssc initialization to complete. However, when the kernel waits too
long for userspace responses (e.g. in nfs4_state_start_net ->
nfsd4_end_grace -> nfsd4_record_grace_done -> nfsd4_cld_grace_done ->
cld_pipe_upcall -> __cld_pipe_upcall -> wait_for_completion path), the
delayed work may start before nfsd_ssc initialization finishes.

Fix this by moving nfsd_ssc initialization before starting laundromat_work.

It reproduced simply with below script:

while [ 1 ]
do
insmod /nfsd.ko
mount -t nfsd none /proc/fs/nfsd
umount /proc/fs/nfsd
rmmod nfsd
done &

So exporting interfaces to user space shall be done at last and
cleanup at first place.

With change there is no Kernel OOPs.

      <title>CVE-2025-38224 - Kvaser PCIEFD Linux Kernel Slab Out-of-Bounds Write</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38224
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 7 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: kvaser_pciefd: refine error prone echo_skb_max handling logic

echo_skb_max should define the supported upper limit of echo_skb[]
allocated inside the netdevice's priv. The corresponding size value
provided by this driver to alloc_candev() is KVASER_PCIEFD_CAN_TX_MAX_COUNT
which is 17.

But later echo_skb_max is rounded up to the nearest power of two (for the
max case, that would be 32) and the tx/ack indices calculated further
during tx/rx may exceed the upper array boundary. Kasan reported this for
the ack case inside kvaser_pciefd_handle_ack_packet(), though the xmit
function has actually caught the same thing earlier.

 BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in kvaser_pciefd_handle_ack_packet+0x2d7/0x92a drivers/net/can/kvaser_pciefd.c:1528

Tx max count definitely matters for kvaser_pciefd_tx_avail(), but for seq
numbers' generation that's not the case - we're free to calculate them as
would be more convenient, not taking tx max count into account. The only
downside is that the size of echo_skb[] should correspond to the max seq
number (not tx max count), so in some situations a bit more memory would
be consumed than could be.

Thus make the size of the underlying echo_skb[] sufficient for the rounded
max tx value.

      <title>CVE-2025-38221 - Linux Kernel ext4 Out-of-Bounds Punch Offset Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38221

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix out of bounds punch offset

Punching a hole with a start offset that exceeds max_end is not
permitted and will result in a negative length in the
truncate_inode_partial_folio() function while truncating the page cache,
potentially leading to undesirable consequences.

A simple reproducer:

  truncate -s 9895604649994 /mnt/foo
  xfs_io -c "pwrite 8796093022208 4096" /mnt/foo

      <title>CVE-2025-38222 - Linux ext4 Inline Data Overflow</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38222
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: inline: fix len overflow in ext4_prepare_inline_data

When running the following code on an ext4 filesystem with inline_data
feature enabled, it will lead to the bug below.

        fd = open("file1", O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0666);
        ftruncate(fd, 30);
        pwrite(fd, "a", 1, (1UL << 40) + 5UL);

That happens because write_begin will succeed as when
ext4_generic_write_inline_data calls ext4_prepare_inline_data, pos + len
will be truncated, leading to ext4_prepare_inline_data parameter to be 6
instead of 0x10000000006.

Then, later when write_end is called, we hit:

        BUG_ON(pos + len > EXT4_I(inode)->i_inline_size);

at ext4_write_inline_data.

Fix it by using a loff_t type for the len parameter in
ext4_prepare_inline_data instead of an unsigned int.

      <title>CVE-2025-38217 - Linux Kernel hwmon ftsteutates Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38217
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 45 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (ftsteutates) Fix TOCTOU race in fts_read()

In the fts_read() function, when handling hwmon_pwm_auto_channels_temp,
the code accesses the shared variable data->fan_source[channel] twice
without holding any locks. It is first checked against
FTS_FAN_SOURCE_INVALID, and if the check passes, it is read again
when used as an argument to the BIT() macro.

This creates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition.
Another thread executing fts_update_device() can modify the value of
data->fan_source[channel] between the check and its use. If the value
is changed to FTS_FAN_SOURCE_INVALID (0xff) during this window, the
BIT() macro will be called with a large shift value (BIT(255)).
A bit shift by a value greater than or equal to the type width is
undefined behavior and can lead to a crash or incorrect values being
returned to userspace.

Fix this by reading data->fan_source[channel] into a local variable
once, eliminating the race condition. Additionally, add a bounds check
to ensure the value is less than BITS_PER_LONG before passing it to
the BIT() macro, making the code more robust against undefined behavior.

This possible bug was found by an experimental static analysis tool
developed by our team.

      <title>CVE-2025-38218 - "QEMU F2FS Linux Kernel Sit Bitmap Size Out-of-Bounds Write Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38218
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 45 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to do sanity check on sit_bitmap_size

w/ below testcase, resize will generate a corrupted image which
contains inconsistent metadata, so when mounting such image, it
will trigger kernel panic:

touch img
truncate -s $((512*1024*1024*1024)) img
mkfs.f2fs -f img $((256*1024*1024))
resize.f2fs -s -i img -t $((1024*1024*1024))
mount img /mnt/f2fs

The reaseon is:

sit_i->bitmap_size is 192, so size of sit bitmap is 192*8=1536, at maximum
there are 1536 sit blocks, however MAIN_SEGS is 261893, so that sit_blk_cnt
is 4762, build_sit_entries() -> current_sit_addr() tries to access
out-of-boundary in sit_bitmap at offset from [1536, 4762), once sit_bitmap
and sit_bitmap_mirror is not the same, it will trigger f2fs_bug_on().

Let's add sanity check in f2fs_sanity_check_ckpt() to avoid panic.

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000

This occurs when processing a symlink inode from the orphan list. The
partial block zeroing code in the truncate path calls
ext4_dirty_journalled_data() -> folio_mark_dirty(). The latter calls
mapping->a_ops->dirty_folio(), but symlink inodes are not assigned an
a_ops vector in ext4, hence the crash.

To avoid this problem, update the ext4_dirty_journalled_data() helper to
only mark the folio dirty on regular files (for which a_ops is
assigned). This also matches the journaling logic in the ext4_symlink()
creation path, where ext4_handle_dirty_metadata() is called directly.

      <title>CVE-2025-38215 - Linux Kernel fbdev Null-Pointer Dereference Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38215
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: Fix do_register_framebuffer to prevent null-ptr-deref in fb_videomode_to_var

If fb_add_videomode() in do_register_framebuffer() fails to allocate
memory for fb_videomode, it will later lead to a null-ptr dereference in
fb_videomode_to_var(), as the fb_info is registered while not having the
mode in modelist that is expected to be there, i.e. the one that is
described in fb_info->var.

Even though fbcon_init() checks beforehand if fb_match_mode() in
var_to_display() fails, it can not prevent the panic because fbcon_init()
does not return error code. Considering this and the comment in the code
about fb_match_mode() returning NULL - "This should not happen" - it is
better to prevent registering the fb_info if its mode was not set
successfully. Also move fb_add_videomode() closer to the beginning of
do_register_framebuffer() to avoid having to do the cleanup on fail.

      <title>CVE-2025-38216 - "Apple IOMMU VT-d Device Aliasing Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38216
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Restore context entry setup order for aliased devices

Commit 2031c469f816 ("iommu/vt-d: Add support for static identity domain")
changed the context entry setup during domain attachment from a
set-and-check policy to a clear-and-reset approach. This inadvertently
introduced a regression affecting PCI aliased devices behind PCIe-to-PCI
bridges.

Specifically, keyboard and touchpad stopped working on several Apple
Macbooks with below messages:

 kernel: platform pxa2xx-spi.3: Adding to iommu group 20
 kernel: input: Apple SPI Keyboard as
 /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.3/pxa2xx-spi.3/spi_master/spi2/spi-APP000D:00/input/input0

Fix this by restoring the previous context setup order.

      <title>CVE-2025-38177 - Linux Kernel - Sch_hfsc Idempotent Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38177
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sch_hfsc: make hfsc_qlen_notify() idempotent

hfsc_qlen_notify() is not idempotent either and not friendly
to its callers, like fq_codel_dequeue(). Let's make it idempotent
to ease qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() callers' life:

1. update_vf() decreases cl->cl_nactive, so we can check whether it is
non-zero before calling it.

2. eltree_remove() always removes RB node cl->el_node, but we can use
   RB_EMPTY_NODE() + RB_CLEAR_NODE() to make it safe.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Contact Form 7 Database Addon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘tmpD’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

      <title>CVE-2025-7066 - Jirafeau MIME Type Bypass Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7066
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Jirafeau normally prevents browser preview for text files due to the possibility that for example SVG and HTML documents could be exploited for cross site scripting. This was done by storing the MIME type of a file and allowing only browser preview for MIME types beginning with image (except for image/svg+xml, see CVE-2022-30110 and CVE-2024-12326), video and audio. However, it was possible to bypass this check by sending a manipulated MIME type containing a comma and an other MIME type like text/html (for example image/png,text/html). Browsers see multiple MIME types and text/html would takes precedence, allowing a possible attacker to do a cross-site scripting attack. The check for MIME types was enhanced to prevent a browser preview when the stored MIME type contains a comma.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38174
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 42 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thunderbolt: Do not double dequeue a configuration request

Some of our devices crash in tb_cfg_request_dequeue():

 general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdead000000000122

 CPU: 6 PID: 91007 Comm: kworker/6:2 Tainted: G U W 6.6.65
 RIP: 0010:tb_cfg_request_dequeue+0x2d/0xa0
 Call Trace:

 kthread+0xed/0x110
 ret_from_fork+0x38/0x50
 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30

The circumstances are unclear, however, the theory is that
tb_cfg_request_work() can be scheduled twice for a request:
first time via frame.callback from ring_work() and second
time from tb_cfg_request().  Both times kworkers will execute
tb_cfg_request_dequeue(), which results in double list_del()
from the ctl->request_queue (the list poison deference hints
at it: 0xdead000000000122).

Do not dequeue requests that don't have TB_CFG_REQUEST_ACTIVE
bit set.

This 'stress-ng' workload causes the concurrent deletions from
'binder_devices' and so requires full-featured synchronization
to prevent list corruption.

I've found this issue independently but pretty sure that syzbot did
the same, so Reported-by: and Closes: should be applicable here as well.

      <title>CVE-2025-7060 - Monitorr Remote File Inclusion Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7060
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 42 minutes ago
<br>

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-5372
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A flaw was found in libssh versions built with OpenSSL versions older than 3.0, specifically in the ssh_kdf() function responsible for key derivation. Due to inconsistent interpretation of return values where OpenSSL uses 0 to indicate failure and libssh uses 0 for success—the function may mistakenly return a success status even when key derivation fails. This results in uninitialized cryptographic key buffers being used in subsequent communication, potentially compromising SSH sessions' confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-49005
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. In Next.js App Router from 15.3.0 to before 15.3.3 and Vercel CLI from 41.4.1 to 42.2.0, a cache poisoning vulnerability was found. The issue allowed page requests for HTML content to return a React Server Component (RSC) payload instead under certain conditions. When deployed to Vercel, this would only impact the browser cache, and would not lead to the CDN being poisoned. When self-hosted and deployed externally, this could lead to cache poisoning if the CDN does not properly distinguish between RSC / HTML in the cache keys. This issue has been resolved in Next.js 15.3.3.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>DjVuLibre is a GPL implementation of DjVu, a web-centric format for distributing documents and images. Prior to version 3.5.29, the MMRDecoder::scanruns method is affected by an OOB-write vulnerability, because it does not check that the xr pointer stays within the bounds of the allocated buffer. This can lead to writes beyond the allocated memory, resulting in a heap corruption condition. An out-of-bounds read with pr is also possible for the same reason. This issue has been patched in version 3.5.29.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34061
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A backdoor in PHPStudy versions 2016 through 2018 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on affected installations. The backdoor listens for base64-encoded PHP payloads in the Accept-Charset HTTP header of incoming requests, decodes and executes the payload without proper validation. This leads to remote code execution as the web server user, compromising the affected system.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34086
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Bolt CMS versions 3.7.0 and earlier contain a chain of vulnerabilities that together allow an authenticated user to achieve remote code execution. A user with valid credentials can inject arbitrary PHP code into the displayname field of the user profile, which is rendered unsanitized in backend templates. The attacker can then list and rename cached session files via the /async/browse/cache/.sessions and /async/folder/rename endpoints. By renaming a .session file to a path under the publicly accessible /files/ directory with a .php extension, the attacker can turn the injected code into an executable web shell. Finally, the attacker triggers the payload via a crafted HTTP GET request to the rogue file.

NOTE: The vendor announced that Bolt 3 reached end-of-life after 31 December 2021.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in Pandora FMS version 7.0NG and earlier. The net_tools.php functionality allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary OS commands via the select_ips parameter when performing network tools operations, such as pinging. This occurs because user input is not properly sanitized before being passed to system commands, enabling command injection.

      <title>CVE-2025-34089 - Aexol Studio Remote for Mac Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34089
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in Remote for Mac, a macOS remote control utility developed by Aexol Studio, in versions up to and including 2025.7. When the application is configured with authentication disabled (i.e., the "Allow unknown devices" option is enabled), the /api/executeScript endpoint is exposed without access control. This allows unauthenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary AppleScript payloads via the X-Script HTTP header, resulting in code execution using do shell script. Successful exploitation grants attackers the ability to run arbitrary commands on the macOS host with the privileges of the Remote for Mac background process.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-52554
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>n8n is a workflow automation platform. Prior to version 1.99.1, an authorization vulnerability was discovered in the /rest/executions/:id/stop endpoint of n8n. An authenticated user can stop workflow executions that they do not own or that have not been shared with them, leading to potential business disruption. This issue has been patched in version 1.99.1. A workaround involves restricting access to the /rest/executions/:id/stop endpoint via reverse proxy or API gateway.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-49846
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>wire-ios is an iOS client for the Wire secure messaging application. From Wire iOS 3.111.1 to before 3.124.1, messages that were visible in the view port have been logged to the iOS system logs in clear text. Wire application logs created and managed by the application itself were not affected, especially not the logs users can export and send to Wire support. The iOS logs can only be accessed if someone had (physical) access to the underlying unlocked device. The issue manifested itself by calling canOpenUrl() and passing an invalid URL object. When iOS then performs the check and fails, it logs the contents to the system log. This is not documented behaviour. Wire released an emergency fix with version 3.124.1. As a workaround, users can reset their iOS device to remove the offending logs. Since Wire cannot access or modify iOS system logs, there's no other workaround other than a reset.

      <title>CVE-2025-48939 - Tarteaucitron.js Script Element Property Clobbering Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48939
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>tarteaucitron.js is a compliant and accessible cookie banner. Prior to version 1.22.0, a vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js where document.currentScript was accessed without verifying that it referenced an actual <script> element. If an attacker injected an HTML element, it could clobber the document.currentScript property. This causes the script to resolve incorrectly to an element instead of the <script> tag, leading to unexpected behavior or failure to load the script path correctly. This issue arises because in some browser environments, named DOM elements become properties on the global document object. An attacker with control over the HTML could exploit this to change the CDN domain of tarteaucitron. This issue has been patched in version 1.22.0.

Dans cette dynamique, les deux agences enrichissent leurs réflexions et harmonisent leurs prises de position au niveau européen sur les règlementations européennes.</p>
<p>Dans ce cadre, elles co-publient aujourd’hui un document conjoint sur la vérification d'identité à distance « Remote Identity Proofing for EUDI Wallet Onboarding : Strengthening Assurance Against Evolving Threats. », suite de la première publication sur le même sujet, mis en ligne en décembre 2023.</p>
<p>En effet, pour mieux répondre aux besoins du marché numérique et renforcer la souveraineté numérique européenne, le cadre réglementaire eIDAS 2 pour l’identification électronique et les services de confiance a été modernisé et adopté en février 2024. Le principal changement structurel apporté par eIDAS 2 repose sur l’introduction d’un European Digital Identity Wallet, portefeuille numérique européen, dont l’obtention peut s’appuyer sur une vérification d’identité à distance.</p>
<p>En cohérence avec ces nouvelles orientations réglementaires, cette seconde édition de ce document conjoint permet de mieux saisir l’engagement de l’ANSSI et du BSI à contribuer activement à l’appropriation du portefeuille numérique européen et à anticiper l’évolution de la menace relative à la vérification d’identité à distance.</p>
<p>La publication met en lumière les progrès réalisés, les défis à relever face aux potentielles attaques et la nécessité d’une approche globale paneuropéenne des tests, de la certification et de la normalisation afin de garantir sécurité, résilience et confiance.</p>

      <title>CVE-2025-43713 - ASNA Assist and ASNA Registrar Deserialization Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-43713
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ASNA Assist and ASNA Registrar before 2025-03-31 allow deserialization attacks against .NET remoting. These are Windows system services that support license key management and deprecated Windows network authentication. The services are implemented with .NET remoting and can be exploited via well-known deserialization techniques inherent in the technology. Because the services run with SYSTEM-level rights, exploits can be crafted to achieve escalation of privilege and arbitrary code execution. This affects DataGate for SQL Server 17.0.36.0 and 16.0.89.0, DataGate Component Suite 17.0.36.0 and 16.0.89.0, DataGate Monitor 17.0.26.0 and 16.0.65.0, DataGate WebPak 17.0.37.0 and 16.0.90.0, Monarch for .NET 11.4.50.0 and 10.0.62.0, Encore RPG 4.1.36.0, Visual RPG .NET FW 17.0.37.0 and 16.0.90.0, Visual RPG .NET FW Windows Deployment 17.0.36.0 and 16.0.89.0, WingsRPG 11.0.38.0 and 10.0.95.0, Mobile RPG 11.0.35.0 and 10.0.94.0, Monarch Framework for .NET FW 11.0.36.0 and 10.0.89.0, Browser Terminal 17.0.37.0 and 16.0.90.0, Visual RPG Classic 5.2.7.0 and 5.1.17.0, Visual RPG Deployment 5.2.7.0 and 5.1.17.0, and DataGate Studio 17.0.38.0 and 16.0.104.0.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-49595
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>n8n is a workflow automation platform. Prior to version 1.99.0, there is a denial of Service vulnerability in /rest/binary-data endpoint when processing empty filesystem URIs (filesystem:// or filesystem-v2://). This allows authenticated attackers to cause service unavailability through malformed filesystem URI requests, effecting the /rest/binary-data endpoint and n8n.cloud instances (confirmed HTTP/2 524 timeout responses). Attackers can exploit this by sending GET requests with empty filesystem URIs (filesystem:// or filesystem-v2://) to the /rest/binary-data endpoint, causing resource exhaustion and service disruption. This issue has been patched in version 1.99.0.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-27458
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 54 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The VNC authentication mechanism bases on a challenge-response system where both server and client use the same password for encryption. The challenge is sent from the server to the client, is encrypted by the client and sent back. The server does the same encryption locally and if the responses match it is prooven that the client knows the correct password. Since all VNC communication is unencrypted, an attacker can obtain the challenge and response and try to derive the password from this information.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38151
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/cma: Fix hang when cma_netevent_callback fails to queue_work

The cited commit fixed a crash when cma_netevent_callback was called for
a cma_id while work on that id from a previous call had not yet started.
The work item was re-initialized in the second call, which corrupted the
work item currently in the work queue.

However, it left a problem when queue_work fails (because the item is
still pending in the work queue from a previous call). In this case,
cma_id_put (which is called in the work handler) is therefore not
called. This results in a userspace process hang (zombie process).

Fix this by calling cma_id_put() if queue_work fails.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38153
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: aqc111: fix error handling of usbnet read calls

Syzkaller, courtesy of syzbot, identified an error (see report [1]) in
aqc111 driver, caused by incomplete sanitation of usb read calls'
results. This problem is quite similar to the one fixed in commit
920a9fa27e78 ("net: asix: add proper error handling of usb read errors").

For instance, usbnet_read_cmd() may read fewer than 'size' bytes,
even if the caller expected the full amount, and aqc111_read_cmd()
will not check its result properly. As [1] shows, this may lead
to MAC address in aqc111_bind() being only partly initialized,
triggering KMSAN warnings.

Fix the issue by verifying that the number of bytes read is
as expected and not less.

      <title>CVE-2025-38154 - Linux Kernel BPF Sockmap Use After Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38154
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, sockmap: Avoid using sk_socket after free when sending

The sk->sk_socket is not locked or referenced in backlog thread, and
during the call to skb_send_sock(), there is a race condition with
the release of sk_socket. All types of sockets(tcp/udp/unix/vsock)
will be affected.

Race conditions:
'''
CPU0                               CPU1

backlog::skb_send_sock
  sendmsg_unlocked
    sock_sendmsg
      sock_sendmsg_nosec
                                   close(fd):
                                     ...
                                     ops->release() -> sock_map_close()
                                     sk_socket->ops = NULL
                                     free(socket)
      sock->ops->sendmsg
            ^
            panic here
'''

The ref of psock become 0 after sock_map_close() executed.
'''
void sock_map_close()
{
    ...
    if (likely(psock)) {
    ...
    // !! here we remove psock and the ref of psock become 0
    sock_map_remove_links(sk, psock)
    psock = sk_psock_get(sk);
    if (unlikely(!psock))
        goto no_psock; <=== Control jumps here via goto
        ...
        cancel_delayed_work_sync(&psock->work); <=== not executed
        sk_psock_put(sk, psock);
        ...
}
'''

Based on the fact that we already wait for the workqueue to finish in
sock_map_close() if psock is held, we simply increase the psock
reference count to avoid race conditions.

With this patch, if the backlog thread is running, sock_map_close() will
wait for the backlog thread to complete and cancel all pending work.

If no backlog running, any pending work that hasn't started by then will
fail when invoked by sk_psock_get(), as the psock reference count have
been zeroed, and sk_psock_drop() will cancel all jobs via
cancel_delayed_work_sync().

In summary, we require synchronization to coordinate the backlog thread
and close() thread.

The panic I catched:
'''

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38157
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath9k_htc: Abort software beacon handling if disabled

A malicious USB device can send a WMI_SWBA_EVENTID event from an
ath9k_htc-managed device before beaconing has been enabled. This causes
a device-by-zero error in the driver, leading to either a crash or an
out of bounds read.

Prevent this by aborting the handling in ath9k_htc_swba() if beacons are
not enabled.

      <title>CVE-2025-38158 - Hisi Acc VFio PCI DMA Address Error Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38158
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hisi_acc_vfio_pci: fix XQE dma address error

The dma addresses of EQE and AEQE are wrong after migration and
results in guest kernel-mode encryption services  failure.
Comparing the definition of hardware registers, we found that
there was an error when the data read from the register was
combined into an address. Therefore, the address combination
sequence needs to be corrected.

Even after fixing the above problem, we still have an issue
where the Guest from an old kernel can get migrated to
new kernel and may result in wrong data.

In order to ensure that the address is correct after migration,
if an old magic number is detected, the dma address needs to be
updated.

      <title>CVE-2025-38162 - Linux Kernel Netfilter NFT Set Pipapo Integer Overflow Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38162
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: prevent overflow in lookup table allocation

When calculating the lookup table size, ensure the following
multiplication does not overflow:

- desc->field_len[] maximum value is U8_MAX multiplied by
  NFT_PIPAPO_GROUPS_PER_BYTE(f) that can be 2, worst case.
- NFT_PIPAPO_BUCKETS(f->bb) is 2^8, worst case.
- sizeof(unsigned long), from sizeof(*f->lt), lt in
  struct nft_pipapo_field.

Then, use check_mul_overflow() to multiply by bucket size and then use
check_add_overflow() to the alignment for avx2 (if needed). Finally, add
lt_size_check_overflow() helper and use it to consolidate this.

While at it, replace leftover allocation using the GFP_KERNEL to
GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT for consistency, in pipapo_resize().

The reason is: in fuzzed image, sbi->total_valid_block_count is
inconsistent w/ mapped blocks indexed by inode, so, we should
not trigger panic for such case, instead, let's print log and
set fsck flag.

The reason is f2fs_gc_range() may try to migrate block in curseg, however,
its SSA block is not uptodate due to the last summary block data is still

In this patch, we add a condition in f2fs_gc_range() to check whether
section is opened or not, and skip block migration for opened section.

The panic originates from the assertion BUG_ON(skb_shared(skb)) in
skb_linearize(). A previous commit(see Fixes tag) introduced skb_get()
to avoid race conditions between skb operations in the backlog and skb
release in the recvmsg path. However, this caused the panic to always
occur when skb_linearize is executed.

The "--rx-strp 100000" parameter forces the RX path to use the strparser
module which aggregates data until it reaches 100KB before calling sockmap
logic. The 100KB payload exceeds MAX_MSG_FRAGS, triggering skb_linearize.

To fix this issue, just move skb_get into sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue.

After calling bpf_exec_tx_verdict(), the size of msg_pl->sg may increase,
e.g., when the BPF program executes bpf_msg_push_data().

If the BPF program sets cork_bytes and sg.size is smaller than cork_bytes,
it will return -ENOSPC and attempt to roll back to the non-zero copy
logic. However, during rollback, msg->msg_iter is reset, but since
msg_pl->sg.size has been increased, subsequent executions will exceed the
actual size of msg_iter.
'''
iov_iter_revert(&msg->msg_iter, msg_pl->sg.size - orig_size);
'''

The changes in this commit are based on the following considerations:

1. When cork_bytes is set, rolling back to non-zero copy logic is
pointless and can directly go to zero-copy logic.

2. We can not calculate the correct number of bytes to revert msg_iter.

Assume the original data is "abcdefgh" (8 bytes), and after 3 pushes
by the BPF program, it becomes 11-byte data: "abc?de?fgh?".
Then, we set cork_bytes to 6, which means the first 6 bytes have been
processed, and the remaining 5 bytes "?fgh?" will be cached until the
length meets the cork_bytes requirement.

However, some data in "?fgh?" is not within 'sg->msg_iter'
(but in msg_pl instead), especially the data "?" we pushed.

So it doesn't seem as simple as just reverting through an offset of
msg_iter.

3. For non-TLS sockets in tcp_bpf_sendmsg, when a "cork" situation occurs,
the user-space send() doesn't return an error, and the returned length is
the same as the input length parameter, even if some data is cached.

Additionally, I saw that the current non-zero-copy logic for handling
corking is written as:
'''
line 1177
else if (ret != -EAGAIN) {
	if (ret == -ENOSPC)
		ret = 0;
	goto send_end;
'''

So it's ok to just return 'copied' without error when a "cork" situation
occurs.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: handle hdr_first_de() return value

The hdr_first_de() function returns a pointer to a struct NTFS_DE. This
pointer may be NULL. To handle the NULL error effectively, it is important
to implement an error handler. This will help manage potential errors
consistently.

Additionally, error handling for the return value already exists at other
points where this function is called.

      <title>CVE-2025-38169 - Linux Kernel ARM64 FPSIMD State Clobbering Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38169
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/fpsimd: Avoid clobbering kernel FPSIMD state with SMSTOP

On system with SME, a thread's kernel FPSIMD state may be erroneously
clobbered during a context switch immediately after that state is
restored. Systems without SME are unaffected.

If the CPU happens to be in streaming SVE mode before a context switch
to a thread with kernel FPSIMD state, fpsimd_thread_switch() will
restore the kernel FPSIMD state using fpsimd_load_kernel_state() while
the CPU is still in streaming SVE mode. When fpsimd_thread_switch()
subsequently calls fpsimd_flush_cpu_state(), this will execute an
SMSTOP, causing an exit from streaming SVE mode. The exit from
streaming SVE mode will cause the hardware to reset a number of
FPSIMD/SVE/SME registers, clobbering the FPSIMD state.

Fix this by calling fpsimd_flush_cpu_state() before restoring the kernel
FPSIMD state.

      <title>CVE-2025-38170 - Linux kernel - arm64 FPSIMD SME Trap Handling Stale CPU State Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38170
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/fpsimd: Discard stale CPU state when handling SME traps

The logic for handling SME traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SME set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SME traps enabled). This can result in warnings from
do_sme_acc() where SME traps are not expected while TIF_SME is set:

|        /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */
|        if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))
|                WARN_ON(1);

This is very similar to the SVE issue we fixed in commit:

  751ecf6afd6568ad ("arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps")

The race can occur when the SME trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sme_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SME clear, SME traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))
|                 WARN_ON(1);
|
|         if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                 unsigned long vq_minus_one =
|                         sve_vq_from_vl(task_get_sme_vl(current)) - 1;
|                 sme_set_vq(vq_minus_one);
|
|                 fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu();
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SME traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38172
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: avoid using multiple devices with different type

For multiple devices, both primary and extra devices should be the
same type. `erofs_init_device` has already guaranteed that if the
primary is a file-backed device, extra devices should also be
regular files.

However, if the primary is a block device while the extra device
is a file-backed device, `erofs_init_device` will get an ENOTBLK,
which is not treated as an error in `erofs_fc_get_tree`, and that
leads to an UAF:

  erofs_fc_get_tree
    get_tree_bdev_flags(erofs_fc_fill_super)
      erofs_read_superblock
        erofs_init_device  // sbi->dif0 is not inited yet,
                           // return -ENOTBLK
      deactivate_locked_super
        free(sbi)
    if (err is -ENOTBLK)
      sbi->dif0.file = filp_open()  // sbi UAF

So if -ENOTBLK is hitted in `erofs_init_device`, it means the
primary device must be a block device, and the extra device
is not a block device. The error can be converted to -EINVAL.

net: phy: mscc: Fix memory leak when using one step timestamping

Fix memory leak when running one-step timestamping. When running
one-step sync timestamping, the HW is configured to insert the TX time
into the frame, so there is no reason to keep the skb anymore. As in
this case the HW will never generate an interrupt to say that the frame
was timestamped, then the frame will never released.
Fix this by freeing the frame in case of one-step timestamping.

      <title>CVE-2025-38149 - Linux Kernel Net Phydev Devlink Crash Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38149
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 53 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: clear phydev->devlink when the link is deleted

There is a potential crash issue when disabling and re-enabling the
network port. When disabling the network port, phy_detach() calls
device_link_del() to remove the device link, but it does not clear
phydev->devlink, so phydev->devlink is not a NULL pointer. Then the
network port is re-enabled, but if phy_attach_direct() fails before
calling device_link_add(), the code jumps to the "error" label and
calls phy_detach(). Since phydev->devlink retains the old value from
the previous attach/detach cycle, device_link_del() uses the old value,
which accesses a NULL pointer and causes a crash. The simplified crash
log is as follows.

[   24.702421] Call trace:
[   24.704856]  device_link_put_kref+0x20/0x120
[   24.709124]  device_link_del+0x30/0x48
[   24.712864]  phy_detach+0x24/0x168
[   24.716261]  phy_attach_direct+0x168/0x3a4

[   24.725140]  phylink_of_phy_connect+0x1c/0x34

Therefore, phydev->devlink needs to be cleared when the device link is
deleted.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38150
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 53 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_packet: move notifier's packet_dev_mc out of rcu critical section

Syzkaller reports the following issue:

Calling `PACKET_ADD_MEMBERSHIP` on an ops-locked device can trigger
the `NETDEV_UNREGISTER` notifier, which may require disabling promiscuous
and/or allmulti mode. Both of these operations require acquiring
the netdev instance lock.

Move the call to `packet_dev_mc` outside of the RCU critical section.
The `mclist` modifications (add, del, flush, unregister) are protected by
the RTNL, not the RCU. The RCU only protects the `sklist` and its
associated `sks`. The delayed operation on the `mclist` entry remains
within the RTNL.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34074
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in Lucee’s administrative interface due to insecure design in the scheduled task functionality. An administrator with access to /lucee/admin/web.cfm can configure a scheduled job to retrieve a remote .cfm file from an attacker-controlled server, which is written to the Lucee webroot and executed with the privileges of the Lucee service account. Because Lucee does not enforce integrity checks, path restrictions, or execution controls for scheduled task fetches, this feature can be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution. This issue is distinct from CVE-2024-55354.

      <title>CVE-2025-34075 - Vagrant Virtual Machine Escape via Ruby Code Injection</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34075
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated virtual machine escape vulnerability exists in HashiCorp Vagrant when using the default synced folder configuration. By design, Vagrant automatically mounts the host system’s project directory into the guest VM under /vagrant (or C:\vagrant on Windows). This includes the Vagrantfile configuration file, which is a Ruby script evaluated by the host every time a vagrant command is executed in the project directory. If a low-privileged attacker obtains shell access to the guest VM, they can append arbitrary Ruby code to the mounted Vagrantfile. When a user on the host later runs any vagrant command, the injected code is executed on the host with that user’s privileges.

 While this shared-folder behavior is well-documented by Vagrant, the security implications of Vagrantfile execution from guest-writable storage are not explicitly addressed. This effectively enables guest-to-host code execution in multi-tenant or adversarial VM scenarios.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated local file inclusion vulnerability exists in Microweber CMS versions <= 1.2.11 through misuse of the backup management API. Authenticated users can abuse the /api/BackupV2/upload and /api/BackupV2/download endpoints to read arbitrary files from the underlying filesystem. By specifying an absolute file path in the src parameter of the upload request, the server may relocate or delete the target file depending on the web service user’s privileges. The corresponding download endpoint can then be used to retrieve the file contents, effectively enabling local file disclosure. This behavior stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied paths and inadequate restrictions on file access and backup logic.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in NSClient++ 0.5.2.35 when both the web interface and ExternalScripts features are enabled. The configuration file (nsclient.ini) stores the administrative password in plaintext and is readable by local users. By extracting this password, an attacker can authenticate to the NSClient++ web interface (typically accessible on port 8443) and abuse the ExternalScripts plugin to inject and execute arbitrary commands as SYSTEM by registering a custom script, saving the configuration, and triggering it via the API.

This behavior is documented but insecure, as the plaintext credential exposure undermines access isolation between local users and administrative functions.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in NSClient++ version 0.5.2.35 when the web interface and ExternalScripts module are enabled. A remote attacker with the administrator password can authenticate to the web interface (default port 8443), inject arbitrary commands as external scripts via the /settings/query.json API, save the configuration, and trigger the script via the /query/{name} endpoint. The injected commands are executed with SYSTEM privileges, enabling full remote compromise.

This capability is an intended feature, but the lack of safeguards or privilege separation makes it risky when exposed to untrusted actors.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34090
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A security bypass vulnerability exists in Google Chrome AppBound cookie encryption mechanism due to insufficient validation of COM server paths during inter-process communication. A local low-privileged attacker can hijack the COM class identifier (CLSID) registration used by Chrome's elevation service and point it to a non-existent or malicious binary. When this hijack occurs, Chrome silently falls back to the legacy cookie encryption mechanism (protected only by user-DPAPI), thereby enabling cookie decryption by any user-context malware without SYSTEM-level access. This flaw bypasses the protections intended by the AppBound encryption design and allows cookie theft from Chromium-based browsers.

Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34091
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A padding oracle vulnerability exists in Google Chrome’s AppBound cookie encryption mechanism due to observable decryption failure behavior in Windows Event Logs when handling malformed ciphertext in SYSTEM-DPAPI-encrypted blobs. A local attacker can repeatedly send malformed ciphertexts to the Chrome elevation service and distinguish between padding and MAC errors, enabling a padding oracle attack. This allows partial decryption of the SYSTEM-DPAPI layer and eventual recovery of the user-DPAPI encrypted cookie key, which is trivially decrypted by the attacker’s own context. This issue undermines the core purpose of AppBound Encryption by enabling low-privileged cookie theft through cryptographic misuse and verbose error feedback.

Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.

This behavior arises from a combination of Chrome’s AppBound implementation and the way Microsoft Windows DPAPI reports decryption failures via Event Logs. As such, the vulnerability relies on cryptographic behavior and error visibility in all supported versions of Windows.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A cookie encryption bypass vulnerability exists in Google Chrome’s AppBound mechanism due to weak path validation logic within the elevation service. When Chrome encrypts a cookie key, it records its own executable path as validation metadata. Later, when decrypting, the elevation service compares the requesting process’s path to this stored path. However, due to path canonicalization inconsistencies, an attacker can impersonate Chrome (e.g., by naming their binary chrome.exe and placing it in a similar path) and successfully retrieve the encrypted cookie key. This allows malicious processes to retrieve cookies intended to be restricted to the Chrome process only.

Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.

      <title>CVE-2025-53359 - Ethereum Crate Signature Malleability Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53359
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 15 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ethereum is a common ethereum structs for Rust. Prior to ethereum crate v0.18.0, signature malleability (according to EIP-2) was only checked for "legacy" transactions, but not for EIP-2930, EIP-1559 and EIP-7702 transactions. This is a specification deviation. The signature malleability itself is not a security issue and not as high of a risk if the ethereum crate is used on a single-implementation blockchain. This issue has been patched in version v0.18.0. A workaround for this issue involves manually checking transaction malleability outside of the crate, however upgrading is recommended.

This issue has been patched in version 2.9.11. A workaround involves setting SecParseXmlIntoArgs to Off.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53006
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 51 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>DataEase is an open source business intelligence and data visualization tool. Prior to version 2.10.11, in both PostgreSQL and Redshift, apart from parameters like "socketfactory" and "socketfactoryarg", there are also "sslfactory" and "sslfactoryarg" with similar functionality. The difference lies in that "sslfactory" and related parameters need to be triggered after establishing the connection. Other similar parameters include "sslhostnameverifier", "sslpasswordcallback", and "authenticationPluginClassName". This issue has been patched in 2.10.11.

      <title>CVE-2025-53106 - Graylog API Token Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53106
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 53 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Graylog is a free and open log management platform. In versions 6.2.0 to before 6.2.4 and 6.3.0-alpha.1 to before 6.3.0-rc.2, Graylog users can gain elevated privileges by creating and using API tokens for the local Administrator or any other user for whom the malicious user knows the ID. For the attack to succeed, the attacker needs a user account in Graylog. They can then proceed to issue hand-crafted requests to the Graylog REST API and exploit a weak permission check for token creation. This issue has been patched in versions 6.2.4 and 6.3.0-rc.2. A workaround involves disabling the respective configuration found in System > Configuration > Users > "Allow users to create personal access tokens".

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34071
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A remote code execution vulnerability in GFI Kerio Control 9.4.5 allows attackers with administrative access to upload and execute arbitrary code through the firmware upgrade feature. The system upgrade mechanism accepts unsigned .img files, which can be modified to include malicious scripts within the upgrade.sh or disk image components. These modified upgrade images are not validated for authenticity or integrity, and are executed by the system post-upload, enabling root access.

      <title>CVE-2025-34072 - "Anthropic Slack MCP Server Data Exfiltration Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34072
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A data exfiltration vulnerability exists in Anthropic’s deprecated Slack Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server via automatic link unfurling. When an AI agent using the Slack MCP Server processes untrusted data, it can be manipulated to generate messages containing attacker-crafted hyperlinks embedding sensitive data. Slack’s link preview bots (e.g., Slack-LinkExpanding, Slackbot, Slack-ImgProxy) will then issue outbound requests to the attacker-controlled URL, resulting in zero-click exfiltration of private data.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34073
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unauthenticated command injection vulnerability exists in stamparm/maltrail (Maltrail) versions <=0.54. A remote attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands via the username parameter in a POST request to the /login endpoint. This occurs due to unsafe handling of user-supplied input passed to subprocess.check_output() in core/http.py, allowing injection of shell metacharacters. Exploitation does not require authentication and commands are executed with the privileges of the Maltrail process.

      <title>CVE-2025-49588 - Linkwarden File Path Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-49588
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Linkwarden is a self-hosted, open-source collaborative bookmark manager to collect, organize and archive webpages. In version 2.10.2, the server accepts links of format file:///etc/passwd and doesn't do any validation before sending them to parsers and playwright, this can result in leak of other user's links (and in some cases it might be possible to leak environment secrets). This issue has been patched in version 2.10.3 which has not been made public at time of publication.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-27026
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A missing double-check feature in the WebGUI for CLI deactivation in Infinera G42 
version R6.1.3 allows an authenticated administrator to make other 
management interfaces unavailable via local and network interfaces. The CLI deactivation via the WebGUI does not only stop CLI interface but deactivates also Linux Shell, WebGUI and Physical Serial Console access. No 
confirmation is asked at deactivation time. Loosing access to these services device administrators are at risk of completely loosing device control.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34069
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in GFI Kerio Control 9.4.5 due to insecure default proxy configuration and weak access control in the GFIAgent service. The non-transparent proxy on TCP port 3128 can be used to forward unauthenticated requests to internal services such as GFIAgent, bypassing firewall restrictions and exposing internal management endpoints. This enables unauthenticated attackers to access the GFIAgent service on ports 7995 and 7996, retrieve the appliance UUID, and issue administrative requests via the proxy. Exploitation results in full administrative access to the Kerio Control appliance.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34070
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A missing authentication vulnerability in the GFIAgent component of GFI Kerio Control 9.4.5 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform privileged operations. The GFIAgent service, responsible for integration with GFI AppManager, exposes HTTP services on ports 7995 and 7996 without proper authentication. The /proxy handler on port 7996 allows arbitrary forwarding to administrative endpoints when provided with an Appliance UUID, which itself can be retrieved from port 7995. This results in a complete authentication bypass, permitting access to sensitive administrative APIs.

      <title>CVE-2025-24332 - Nokia Single RAN AirScale Baseband SSH Privilege Escalation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-24332
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 6 hours, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Nokia Single RAN AirScale baseband allows an authenticated administrative user access to all physical boards after performing a single login to the baseband system board. The baseband does not re-authenticate the user when they connect from the baseband system board to the baseband capacity boards using the internal bsoc SSH service, which is available only internally within the baseband and through the internal backplane between the boards. The bsoc SSH allows login from one board to another via the baseband internal backplane using an SSH private key present on the baseband system board.

This bsoc SSH capability was previously considered an administrative functionality but has now been restricted to be available only to baseband root-privileged administrators. This restriction mitigates the possibility of misuse with lower-level privileges (e.g., from baseband software images). This mitigation is included starting from release 23R4-SR 3.0 MP and later

      <title>CVE-2025-24331 - Nokia Single RAN Root Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-24331
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Single RAN baseband OAM service is intended to run as an unprivileged service. However, it initially starts with root privileges and assigns certain capabilities before dropping to an unprivileged level. The capabilities retained from the root period are considered extensive after the privilege drop and, in theory, could potentially allow actions beyond the intended scope of the OAM service. These actions could include gaining root privileges, accessing root-owned files, modifying them as the file owner, and then returning them to root ownership. This issue has been corrected starting from release 24R1-SR 0.2 MP and later.

Beginning with release 24R1-SR 0.2 MP, the OAM service software capabilities are restricted to the minimum necessary.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Sending a crafted SOAP "set" operation message within the Mobile Network Operator (MNO) internal Radio Access Network (RAN) management network can cause Nokia Single RAN baseband OAM service component restart with software versions earlier than release 24R1-SR 1.0 MP. This issue has been corrected to release 24R1-SR 1.0 MP and later.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-13786
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 6 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The education theme for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.10 via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'themerex_callback_view_more_posts' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-46993
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 1, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 10 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Electron is an open source framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In versions prior to 28.3.2, 29.3.3, and 30.0.3, the nativeImage.createFromPath() and nativeImage.createFromBuffer() functions call a function downstream that is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. An Electron program that uses either of the affected functions is vulnerable to a buffer overflow if an attacker is in control of the image's height, width, and contents. This issue has been patched in versions  28.3.2, 29.3.3, and 30.0.3. There are no workarounds for this issue.

      <title>CVE-2024-49364 - Tiny-SECP256k1 Buffer Package Private Key Extraction Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-49364
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 1, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 10 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>tiny-secp256k1 is a tiny secp256k1 native/JS wrapper. Prior to version 1.1.7, a private key can be extracted on signing a malicious JSON-stringifiable object, when global Buffer is the buffer package. This affects only environments where require('buffer') is the NPM buffer package. The Buffer.isBuffer check can be bypassed, resulting in k reuse for different messages, leading to private key extraction over a single invalid message (and a second one for which any message/signature could be taken, e.g. previously known valid one). This issue has been patched in version 1.1.7.

      <title>CVE-2024-49365 - Tiny-SECP256K1 JSON-Stringifyable Message Verification Bypass Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-49365
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 1, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 10 hours, 47 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>tiny-secp256k1 is a tiny secp256k1 native/JS wrapper. Prior to version 1.1.7, a malicious JSON-stringifyable message can be made passing on verify(), when global Buffer is the buffer package. This affects only environments where require('buffer') is the NPM buffer package. Buffer.isBuffer check can be bypassed, resulting in strange objects being accepted as a message, and those messages could trick verify() into returning false-positive true values. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.7.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-46992
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 1, 2025, 2:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 47 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Electron is an open source framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. From versions 30.0.0-alpha.1 to before 30.0.5 and 31.0.0-alpha.1 to before 31.0.0-beta.1, Electron is vulnerable to an ASAR Integrity bypass. This only impacts apps that have the embeddedAsarIntegrityValidation and onlyLoadAppFromAsar fuses enabled. Apps without these fuses enabled are not impacted. This issue is specific to Windows, apps using these fuses on macOS are not impacted. Specifically this issue can only be exploited if the app is launched from a filesystem the attacker has write access too. i.e. the ability to edit files inside the .app bundle on macOS which these fuses are supposed to protect against. This issue has been patched in versions 30.0.5 and 31.0.0-beta.1. There are no workarounds for this issue.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53095
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 1, 2025, 2:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 47 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Sunshine is a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight. Prior to version 2025.628.4510, the web UI of Sunshine lacks protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious web page that, when visited by an authenticated user, can trigger unintended actions within the Sunshine application on behalf of that user. Specifically, since the application does OS command execution by design, this issue can be exploited to abuse the "Command Preparations" feature, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed with Administrator privileges when an application is launched. This issue has been patched in version 2025.628.4510.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-52901
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 25 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. Prior to version 2.33.9, access tokens are used as GET parameters. The JSON Web Token (JWT) which is used as a session identifier will get leaked to anyone having access to the URLs accessed by the user. This will give an attacker full access to a user's account and, in consequence, to all sensitive files the user has access to. This issue has been patched in version 2.33.9.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-52995
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 25 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. Prior to version 2.33.10, the implementation of the allowlist is erroneous, allowing a user to execute more shell commands than they are authorized for. The concrete impact of this vulnerability depends on the commands configured, and the binaries installed on the server or in the container image. Due to the missing separation of scopes on the OS-level, this could give an attacker access to all files managed the application, including the File Browser database. This issue has been patched in version 2.33.10.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. In versions 2.32.0 and prior, the implementation of password protected links is error-prone, resulting in potential unprotected sharing of a file through a direct download link.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46702
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Mattermost versions 10.5.x <= 10.5.5, 9.11.x <= 9.11.15, 10.8.x <= 10.8.0, 10.7.x <= 10.7.2, 10.6.x <= 10.6.5 fail to properly enforce channel member management permissions when adding participants to playbook runs. This allows authenticated users with member-level permissions to bypass system admin restrictions and add or remove users to/from private channels via the playbook run participants feature, even when the 'Manage Members' permission has been explicitly removed. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive channel content and allow guest users to gain channel management privileges.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Host Header Injection (HHI) vulnerability in the Hotspot Shield VPN client, which can induce unexpected behaviour when accessing third-party web applications through the VPN tunnel. Although such applications do not present this vulnerability per se, the use of the tunnel, together with a forged Host header, can cause the VPN client to redirect or forward HTTP requests to servers other than those originally intended, leading to consequences such as open redirects or delivery of traffic to infrastructure controlled by an attacker. This does not imply a flaw in the target applications, but in how the VPN client internally handles outgoing headers and requests.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38090
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 6 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers/rapidio/rio_cm.c: prevent possible heap overwrite

In

riocm_cdev_ioctl(RIO_CM_CHAN_SEND)
   -> cm_chan_msg_send()
      -> riocm_ch_send()

cm_chan_msg_send() checks that userspace didn't send too much data but
riocm_ch_send() failed to check that userspace sent sufficient data.  The
result is that riocm_ch_send() can write to fields in the rio_ch_chan_hdr
which were outside the bounds of the space which cm_chan_msg_send()
allocated.

Address this by teaching riocm_ch_send() to check that the entire
rio_ch_chan_hdr was copied in from userspace.

      <title>CVE-2025-38089 - SunRPC Authentication Error Handling Remote Crash Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38089
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sunrpc: handle SVC_GARBAGE during svc auth processing as auth error

tianshuo han reported a remotely-triggerable crash if the client sends a
kernel RPC server a specially crafted packet. If decoding the RPC reply
fails in such a way that SVC_GARBAGE is returned without setting the
rq_accept_statp pointer, then that pointer can be dereferenced and a
value stored there.

If it's the first time the thread has processed an RPC, then that
pointer will be set to NULL and the kernel will crash. In other cases,
it could create a memory scribble.

The server sunrpc code treats a SVC_GARBAGE return from svc_authenticate
or pg_authenticate as if it should send a GARBAGE_ARGS reply. RFC 5531
says that if authentication fails that the RPC should be rejected
instead with a status of AUTH_ERR.

Handle a SVC_GARBAGE return as an AUTH_ERROR, with a reason of
AUTH_BADCRED instead of returning GARBAGE_ARGS in that case. This
sidesteps the whole problem of touching the rpc_accept_statp pointer in
this situation and avoids the crash.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38087
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: fix use-after-free in taprio_dev_notifier

Since taprio’s taprio_dev_notifier() isn’t protected by an
RCU read-side critical section, a race with advance_sched()
can lead to a use-after-free.

Adding rcu_read_lock() inside taprio_dev_notifier() prevents this.

      <title>CVE-2025-38086 - "NetChip Ch9200 Uninitialized Memory Access Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38086
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 28, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 12 hours, 24 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ch9200: fix uninitialised access during mii_nway_restart

In mii_nway_restart() the code attempts to call
mii->mdio_read which is ch9200_mdio_read(). ch9200_mdio_read()
utilises a local buffer called "buff", which is initialised
with control_read(). However "buff" is conditionally
initialised inside control_read():

        if (err == size) {
                memcpy(data, buf, size);
        }

If the condition of "err == size" is not met, then
"buff" remains uninitialised. Once this happens the
uninitialised "buff" is accessed and returned during
ch9200_mdio_read():

        return (buff[0] | buff[1] << 8);

The problem stems from the fact that ch9200_mdio_read()
ignores the return value of control_read(), leading to
uinit-access of "buff".

To fix this we should check the return value of
control_read() and return early on error.

      <title>CVE-2025-38084 - Linux Kernel Hugetlb Racy Protection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38084
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 28, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 11 hours, 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb: unshare page tables during VMA split, not before

Currently, __split_vma() triggers hugetlb page table unsharing through
vm_ops->may_split().  This happens before the VMA lock and rmap locks are
taken - which is too early, it allows racing VMA-locked page faults in our
process and racing rmap walks from other processes to cause page tables to
be shared again before we actually perform the split.

Fix it by explicitly calling into the hugetlb unshare logic from
__split_vma() in the same place where THP splitting also happens.  At that
point, both the VMA and the rmap(s) are write-locked.

An annoying detail is that we can now call into the helper
hugetlb_unshare_pmds() from two different locking contexts:

1. from hugetlb_split(), holding:
    - mmap lock (exclusively)
    - VMA lock
    - file rmap lock (exclusively)
2. hugetlb_unshare_all_pmds(), which I think is designed to be able to
   call us with only the mmap lock held (in shared mode), but currently
   only runs while holding mmap lock (exclusively) and VMA lock

Backporting note:
This commit fixes a racy protection that was introduced in commit
b30c14cd6102 ("hugetlb: unshare some PMDs when splitting VMAs"); that
commit claimed to fix an issue introduced in 5.13, but it should actually
also go all the way back.

      <title>CVE-2025-38085 - Linux Kernel: Huge Page Table Unshare Race Condition Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38085
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 28, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 11 hours, 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb: fix huge_pmd_unshare() vs GUP-fast race

huge_pmd_unshare() drops a reference on a page table that may have
previously been shared across processes, potentially turning it into a
normal page table used in another process in which unrelated VMAs can
afterwards be installed.

If this happens in the middle of a concurrent gup_fast(), gup_fast() could
end up walking the page tables of another process.  While I don't see any
way in which that immediately leads to kernel memory corruption, it is
really weird and unexpected.

Fix it with an explicit broadcast IPI through tlb_remove_table_sync_one(),
just like we do in khugepaged when removing page tables for a THP
collapse.

      <title>CVE-2025-53097 - Roo Code Schema Fetching File Read and Write Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53097
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 27, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 36 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent. Prior to version 3.20.3, there was an issue where the Roo Code agent's `search_files` tool did not respect the setting to disable reads outside of the VS Code workspace. This means that an attacker who was able to inject a prompt into the agent could potentially read a sensitive file and then write the information to a JSON schema. Users have the option to disable schema fetching in VS Code, but the feature is enabled by default. For users with this feature enabled, writing to the schema would trigger a network request without the user having a chance to deny. This issue is of moderate severity, since it requires the attacker to already be able to submit prompts to the agent. Version 3.20.3 fixed the issue where `search_files` did not respect the setting to limit it to the workspace. This reduces the scope of the damage if an attacker is able to take control of the agent through prompt injection or another vector.

      <title>CVE-2025-53098 - Roo Code MCP Configuration Command Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53098
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 27, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 36 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent. The project-specific MCP configuration for the Roo Code agent is stored in the `.roo/mcp.json` file within the VS Code workspace. Because the MCP configuration format allows for execution of arbitrary commands, prior to version 3.20.3, it would have been possible for an attacker with access to craft a prompt to ask the agent to write a malicious command to the MCP configuration file. If the user had opted-in to auto-approving file writes within the project, this would have led to arbitrary command execution. This issue is of moderate severity, since it requires the attacker to already be able to submit prompts to the agent (for instance through a prompt injection attack), for the user to have MCP enabled (on by default), and for the user to have enabled auto-approved file writes (off by default). Version 3.20.3 fixes the issue by adding an additional layer of opt-in configuration for auto-approving writing to Roo's configuration files, including all files within the `.roo/` folder.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53094
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 27, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 8 hours, 1 minute ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ESPAsyncWebServer is an asynchronous HTTP and WebSocket server library for ESP32, ESP8266, RP2040 and RP2350. In versions up to and including 3.7.8, a CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) injection vulnerability exists in the construction and output of HTTP headers within `AsyncWebHeader.cpp`. Unsanitized input allows attackers to inject CR (`\r`) or LF (`\n`) characters into header names or values, leading to arbitrary header or response manipulation. Manipulation of HTTP headers and responses can enable a wide range of attacks, making the severity of this vulnerability high. A fix is available at pull request 211 and is expected to be part of version 3.7.9.

      <title>CVE-2025-52553 - Authentik RAC Token Session Hijacking Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-52553
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 27, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>authentik is an open-source identity provider. After authorizing access to a RAC endpoint, authentik creates a token which is used for a single connection and is sent to the client in the URL. This token is intended to only be valid for the session of the user who authorized the connection, however this check is missing in versions prior to 2025.6.3 and 2025.4.3. When, for example, using RAC during a screenshare, a malicious user could access the same session by copying the URL from the shown browser. authentik 2025.4.3 and 2025.6.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, it is recommended to decrease the duration a token is valid for (in the RAC Provider settings, set Connection expiry to `minutes=5` for example). The maintainers of authentik also recommend enabling the option Delete authorization on disconnect.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53018
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 27, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 36 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Lychee is a free, open-source photo-management tool. Prior to version 6.6.13, a critical Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `/api/v2/Photo::fromUrl` endpoint. This flaw lets an attacker instruct the application’s backend to make HTTP requests to any URL they choose. Consequently, internal network resources—such as localhost services or cloud-provider metadata endpoints—become reachable. The endpoint takes a URL from the user and calls it server-side via fopen() without any safeguards. There is no IP address validation, nor are there any allow-list, timeout, or size restrictions. Because of this, attackers can point the application at internal targets. Using this flaw, an attacker can perform internal port scans or retrieve sensitive cloud metadata. Version 6.6.13 contains a patch for the issue.

            <div class="field field--name-field-chapo field--type-string-long field--label-hidden field__item">À l’occasion de la publication de la quatrième édition de l’Observatoire des métiers, le Centre de Formation à la Sécurité des Systèmes d’Information (CFSSI) de l’ANSSI, en partenariat avec l’AFPA et la DGEFP, fait le point sur les évolutions du marché de l’emploi dans le domaine de la cybersécurité, au cours des cinq dernières années.</div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-texte-riche field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Face à une menace cyber toujours plus présente, les différents acteurs du secteur public et privé se doivent de mettre en place des stratégies efficaces pour se protéger. À l’heure où le recrutement de spécialistes en matière de sécurité des systèmes d’information apparaît, de fait, essentiel, l’analyse du marché du travail réalisée dans cette 4<sup>e</sup> édition de l’Observatoire des métiers démontre que le nombre d’offres d’emploi disponibles a considérablement augmenté dans ce secteur.</p>
<p>Seulement, les employeurs continuent à rencontrer de grandes difficultés pour trouver des candidats, et ce, malgré le développement de nombreuses offres de formations pour répondre aux besoins du marché.</p>
<h3>Le rôle de l’Observatoire des métiers</h3>
<p>Afin de comprendre les raisons réelles de cette pénurie et d’identifier les leviers les plus pertinents qui pourraient permettre aux politiques publiques de lancer des initiatives capables de résoudre la situation, l’ANSSI, la Délégation générale à l’Emploi et à la Formation professionnelle (DGEFP) et l’Agence nationale pour la formation professionnelle des adultes (Afpa), recensent et collectent des indicateurs concernant les formations en cybersécurité ainsi que les offres d’emploi dans ce domaine, depuis 2021, via l’Observatoire des métiers.</p>
<h3>Les résultats de l’enquête 2025 réalisée auprès des professionnels de la cybersécurité</h3>
<p>En 2025, l’Observatoire des métiers a reconduit l’enquête menée en 2021 auprès des professionnels de la cybersécurité afin de réaliser une photographie générale de la population composant l’écosystème cyber français. L’objectif étant de mieux connaître certaines de leurs caractéristiques : parcours, profils, cadres d’exercices des missions et perspectives d’évolutions.</p>
<h4>Quelques chiffres clés</h4>
<ul><li>1 répondant sur 2 travaille dans une structure de 1 000 salariés ou plus et 66 % des répondants travaillent dans le secteur privé.</li>
<li>Une large majorité d’hommes, soit 85 % des répondants, composent l’écosystème cyber français.</li>
<li>Pour la moitié des répondants, la cybersécurité ne constitue pas leur domaine d’expertise d’origine. En effet, 40 % des répondants ont principalement exercé dans le domaine de l’informatique/ numérique et 12 % ont principalement exercé dans un autre domaine.</li>
</ul><h3>Les résultats de l’étude 2025 menée sur le marché du travail des professionnels de la cybersécurité</h3>
<p>Cette seconde enquête, réalisée à partir d’un un outil d’agrégation, a permis de quantifier et d’analyser plus de 23 000 offres d’emploi publiées entre juin 2023 et juin 2024, dans le domaine de la cybersécurité, en France. L’objectif ? Identifier les grandes tendances du marché, notamment les types d’offres, le niveau de qualifications attendu ou encore la localisation des offres.</p>
<h4>Quelques chiffres clés</h4>
<ul><li>Une augmentation de 49 % du nombres d’offres d’emploi s’est opérée entre 2019 et 2024.</li>
<li>Une large majorité des offres concernent des contrats à durée indéterminée.</li>
<li>Le niveau de qualification reste élevé avec 40 % des offres qui requièrent un niveau Bac+5.</li>

<p>L’étude propose en effet un nouvel outil mathématique appelé <em>« syzygy distinguisher »</em>. Déjà utilisé en cryptographie, les distinguisher ont toutefois montré des limites face à certains problèmes complexes de cryptographie. Celui proposé par Hugues dans son papier offre des résultats considérablement supérieurs lorsqu’il s’agit de reconnaître des codes cryptographiques utilisés pour sécuriser les communications, notamment dans le cadre de la cryptographie post-quantique.</p>
<p>L’attribution de ce prix constitue une reconnaissance forte des travaux menés par Hugues Randriam et par l’ensemble du laboratoire de cryptographie de l’ANSSI. Elle souligne également l’engagement constant des équipes de l’Agence dans la recherche scientifique.</p>
<p>C’est une grande fierté pour l’ANSSI, non seulement pour le rayonnement de ses laboratoires, mais aussi pour le travail mené au quotidien par l’ensemble de ses agents.</p>

<p>Les « parcours de cybersécurité » avaient pour objectif d’élever la sécurité numérique des services publics, de dynamiser l’industrie de cybersécurité française et européenne et de favoriser des investissements durables au service de la cybersécurité des organisations.</p>
<p>Pendant 4 ans, l’ANSSI a conçu, déployé et piloté un dispositif d’accompagnement au profit des collectivités, des établissements de santé et des entités publiques. Ainsi, 945 entités parmi les plus vulnérables à la menace cyber ont pu bénéficier de cet accompagnement, dont :</p>
<ul><li>707 collectivités territoriales,</li>
<li>134 établissements de santé,</li>
<li>87 autres établissements publics,</li>
<li>17 centres de recherche et d’enseignement supérieur,</li>
</ul><p>Parmi celles-ci, 62 entités ont été accompagnées dans les territoires d’Outre-mer.</p>
<p>Les parcours ont permis d’élever le niveau de cyberdéfense des bénéficiaires de manière significative : en moyenne, les bénéficiaires sont passés d’un score de maturité cyber de D+ à B, soulignant un progrès conséquent. Grâce aux parcours, les entités ont réussi à s’intégrer dans l’écosystème cyber de leur territoire et de leur secteur, en lien avec l’ANSSI, et sont ainsi solidement ancrées dans une démarche de sécurisation à long terme.</p>
<p>Au-delà des bénéfices pour les entités accompagnées, les parcours de cybersécurité laissent un héritage exploitable dans la durée, notamment dans la perspective de la mise en œuvre de la directive NIS 2 avec la mise à disposition d’outils et de méthodes adaptés aux besoins de chaque bénéficiaire.</p>
<p>Le programme a permis de dynamiser l’offre industrielle de cybersécurité dans les territoires et de renforcer l’offre française et européenne de cybersécurité :</p>
<ul><li>197 prestataires présents sur l’ensemble du territoire national ont été impliqués.</li>
<li>40 millions d’euros ont été dédiés à l’acquisition de produits de cybersécurité français et européens (dont 33 millions d’euros pour des produits français).</li>
</ul><p>Les parcours de cybersécurité sont un succès, avec des effets tangibles et durables pour les bénéficiaires. Ils font partie d'un programme plus large de soutien à la transformation numérique et à la résilience des systèmes d'information, dans un contexte où les cybermenaces se multiplient.</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-texte-riche field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Les transports urbains constituent un secteur critique et les attaques informatiques qui le visent peuvent avoir des conséquences significatives qui génèrent parfois des difficultés dans la continuité des services ou encore dans la sécurisation des données. La menace à l’encontre des entités du secteur cible des entreprises de toute taille, dans le monde entier, et qui ont la gestion d’une large variété de moyen de transports. Répondant à ses missions de connaissance de la menace informatique, l’ANSSI partage un état de la menace sur le secteur du transport urbain.</p>
<h3><strong>Un secteur fortement exposé en 2024</strong></h3>
<p>Tout au long de l’année, le contexte des Jeux Olympiques et Paralympiques de Paris 2024 a mis en lumière l’exposition de ce secteur aux cyberattaques, les tensions géopolitiques ayant été un catalyseur fort de cette menace avec de nombreuses attaques par déni de services.</p>
<p>L’imbrication de plusieurs réseaux informatiques de grande taille ainsi que la diversité des équipements qui les composent met en exergue des niveaux de sécurisation hétérogène complexifiant d’autant plus les questions de sécurité des systèmes d’information et augmentant significativement la surface d’attaque.</p>
<p>Les entités du secteur sont également fortement ciblées en raison du grand nombre de données personnelles des usagers, ainsi une attention toute particulière doit être portée à la protection de ces bases de données qui font régulièrement l’objet d’attaques à des fins d’exfiltration.</p>
<h3><strong>Prévenir et se protéger contre ces menaces</strong></h3>
<p>Dans son état de la menace, l’ANSSI rappelle l’importance d’avoir une approche globale de la sécurité et recommande aux entités de réaliser une cartographie globale des systèmes d’information afin d’identifier les risques affectant l’entité ou encore mesurer la maturité des systèmes d’informations concernés.</p>
<p>Il est essentiel de travailler sur des modes de fonctionnement dégradé notamment pour assurer et préparer en parallèle un <strong>plan de continuité d’activité (PCA)</strong> et un <strong>plan de reprise d’activité (PRA)</strong>. La mise en pratique ces recommandations permettra au secteur des transports urbains d’anticiper ces menaces.</p>

<h3><strong>Les Jeux olympiques et paralympiques de Paris 2024 comme consécration du modèle français de cyberdéfense</strong></h3>
<p>En tant que cheffe de file du volet cyber, l’ANSSI a été au cœur de la préparation des Jeux olympiques et paralympiques de Paris 2024. Le succès de cet événement international majeur est un accomplissement pour l’Agence, qui témoigne également de la pertinence du modèle de cyberdéfense français bâti autour d’une autorité nationale et ancré dans un écosystème élargi et déployé dans les territoires. Les Jeux sont le résultat d’une méthode – anticipation, préparation, entraînement – et d’une équipe – l’écosystème cyber public et privé – qui doivent perdurer pour<strong> permettre à la France de rester parmi les grandes nations de la cybersécurité.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>La directive NIS 2, vecteur d’une transformation profonde pour l’ANSSI</strong></h3>
<p>En 2024, l’ANSSI a poursuivi ses travaux de transposition de la directive NIS 2 qui sont le moteur d’un changement majeur de son organisation, de ses méthodes et de sa manière d’interagir avec ses bénéficiaires et ses partenaires. Déjà fortement mobilisées sur le sujet au cours des dernières années, les équipes de l’Agence continueront de l’être au quotidien, en coordination avec l’écosystème cyber, pour accompagner des milliers d’entités dans leur cybersécurité.</p>
<h3><strong>Des progrès précieux pour l’élévation générale de la cybersécurité de l’Union européenne</strong></h3>
<p>À l’image du cadre réglementaire défini par NIS 2, ou encore du vote du règlement sur la résilience cyber, pour lesquels l’ANSSI s’est pleinement engagée, la cybersécurité en Europe a connu de belles avancées en 2024. Par ailleurs, face aux évolutions technologiques, et notamment aux technologies de rupture, la conservation d’une maîtrise souveraine des expertises techniques s’impose comme une mission essentielle de l’ANSSI.</p>
<h4><strong>L’année 2024 en quelques chiffres :</strong></h4>
<ul><li><strong>656 </strong>agents âgés en moyenne de <strong>36 </strong>ans, œuvrent au quotidien pour la cybersécurité de la Nation, au sein de l’ANSSI.</li>
<li><strong>4 386 (+15%)</strong> événements de sécurité traités par l’ANSSI, et <strong>1 361 (+18%)</strong> incidents ayant impliqué un acteur malveillant.</li>
<li><strong>68</strong> formations labellisées SecNumedu, <strong>1 696</strong> personnes formées au Centre de formation à la sécurité des systèmes d’information (CFSSI) et <strong>117 856</strong> attestations SecNumacadémie décernées.</li>
</ul><h4><strong>L’année 2024 en quelques dates clés :</strong></h4>
<p>Au-delà des JOP24 d’autres d’événements ont marqué l’année 2024 :</p>
<ul><li><strong>31 janvier</strong> : Adoption du schéma européen de certification de cybersécurité fondé sur des critères commun.</li>
<li><strong>10 mai </strong>: Entrée en vigueur du décret d’application de la loi de programmation militaire 2024-2030, permettant à l’ANSSI de mettre en œuvre l’ensemble des nouvelles capacités dont elle l’a dotée.</li>
<li><strong>9 juillet </strong>: Publications des recommandations de l’ANSSI pour l’hébergement des systèmes d’information sensible dans le cloud.</li>
<li><strong>15 octobre </strong>: Présentation en conseil des ministres du projet de loi relatif à la résilience des activités d’importance vitale, à la protection des infrastructures critiques à la cybersécurité et à la résilience opérationnelle du secteur financier dont le titre II, Cybersécurité, vise à transposer la directive NIS 2.</li>

          Cette année exceptionnelle ouvre désormais la voie à une nouvelle étape pour l’ANSSI, qui a été partagée dans notre stratégie pour 2025-2027 . Il s’agit de prendre acte des évolutions non seulement du paysage cyber, mais également de notre environnement plus global. Pour ce faire, nous aurons besoin de « l’équipe de France » de cybersécurité à nos côtes.
