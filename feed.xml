By default `oak` does not allow transferring of hidden files with `Context.send` API. However, prior to version 17.1.3, this can be bypassed by encoding `/` as its URL encoded form `%2F`.

      <description>Zusam is a free and open-source way to self-host private forums. Prior to version 0.5.6, specially crafted SVG files uploaded to the service as images allow for unrestricted script execution on (raw) image load. With certain payloads, theft of the target user’s long-lived session token is possible. Note that Zusam, at the time of writing, uses a user’s static API key as a long-lived session token, and these terms can be used interchangeably on the platform. This session token/API key remains valid indefinitely, so long as the user doesn’t expressly request a new one via their Settings page.

      <description>golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in "dangerous" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release. We are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code. In case you cannot update to 4.5.0, please make sure that you are properly checking for all errors ("dangerous" ones first), so that you are not running in the case detailed above. | CVSS Score 3.1 (LOW)  </description>

      <description>Meshtastic firmware is a device firmware for the Meshtastic project. The Meshtastic firmware does not check for packets claiming to be from the special broadcast address (0xFFFFFFFF) which could result in unexpected behavior and potential for DDoS attacks on the network. A malicious actor could craft a packet to be from that address which would result in an amplification of this one message into every node on the network sending multiple messages. Such an attack could result in degraded network performance for all users as the available bandwidth is consumed. This issue has been addressed in release version 2.5.6. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | CVSS Score 5.3 (MEDIUM)  </description>

      <description>Refit is an automatic type-safe REST library for .NET Core, Xamarin and .NET The various header-related Refit attributes (Header, HeaderCollection and Authorize) are vulnerable to CRLF injection. The way HTTP headers are added to a request is via the `HttpHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidation` method. This method does not check for CRLF characters in the header value. This means that any headers added to a refit request are vulnerable to CRLF-injection. In general, CRLF-injection into a HTTP header (when using HTTP/1.1) means that one can inject additional HTTP headers or smuggle whole HTTP requests. If an application using the Refit library passes a user-controllable value through to a header, then that application becomes vulnerable to CRLF-injection. This is not necessarily a security issue for a command line application like the one above, but if such code were present in a web application then it becomes vulnerable to request splitting (as shown in the PoC) and thus Server Side Request Forgery. Strictly speaking this is a potential vulnerability in applications using Refit and not in Refit itself. This issue has been addressed in release versions 7.2.22 and 8.0.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>

      <title>CVE-2023-52920 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

bpf support non-r10 register s...</title>
      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

bpf support non-r10 register spill/fill to/from stack in precision tracking

Use instruction (jump) history to record instructions that performed
register spill/fill to/from stack, regardless if this was done through
read-only r10 register, or any other register after copying r10 into it
*and* potentially adjusting offset.

To make this work reliably, we push extra per-instruction flags into
instruction history, encoding stack slot index (spi) and stack frame
number in extra 10 bit flags we take away from prev_idx in instruction
history. We don't touch idx field for maximum performance, as it's
checked most frequently during backtracking.

This change removes basically the last remaining practical limitation of
precision backtracking logic in BPF verifier. It fixes known
deficiencies, but also opens up new opportunities to reduce number of
verified states, explored in the subsequent patches.

There are only three differences in selftests' BPF object files
according to veristat, all in the positive direction (less states).

File                                    Program        Insns (A)  Insns (B)  Insns  (DIFF)  States (A)  States (B)  States (DIFF)
--------------------------------------  -------------  ---------  ---------  -------------  ----------  ----------  -------------
test_cls_redirect_dynptr.bpf.linked3.o  cls_redirect        2987       2864  -123 (-4.12%)         240         231    -9 (-3.75%)
xdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_tc       82848      82661  -187 (-0.23%)        5107        5073   -34 (-0.67%)
xdp_synproxy_kern.bpf.linked3.o         syncookie_xdp      85116      84964  -152 (-0.18%)        5162        5130   -32 (-0.62%)

Note, I avoided renaming jmp_history to more generic insn_hist to
minimize number of lines changed and potential merge conflicts between
bpf and bpf-next trees.

Notice also cur_hist_entry pointer reset to NULL at the beginning of
instruction verification loop. This pointer avoids the problem of
relying on last jump history entry's insn_idx to determine whether we
already have entry for current instruction or not. It can happen that we
added jump history entry because current instruction is_jmp_point(), but
also we need to add instruction flags for stack access. In this case, we
don't want to entries, so we need to reuse last added entry, if it is
present.

Relying on insn_idx comparison has the same ambiguity problem as the one
that was fixed recently in [0], so we avoid that.

<div>Vous avez sans doute déjà vu ces devis délirants pour des panneaux solaires posés sur un toit. Jeff, lui, a pris le problème à l'envers. Avec des <strong>pièces de récupération automobile</strong> et un peu de jugeote, il a construit un tracker solaire capable de suivre le soleil.

<div>Lancé à 499 € avec beaucoup d'arrogance, le <strong>Sonos Ace</strong> a eu du mal à trouver son public. Mais le Black Friday remet les pendules à l'heure. Avec le code <strong>BF25</strong>, il tombe à <strong>274,99 €</strong> chez Boulanger. À ce prix-là, on oublie les polémiques de lancement et on profite de l'une des meilleures finitions du marché.</div>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="chapo has-text-weight-semibold mb-5">

Pour ce Black Friday, la marque fait un effort rare  le modèle standard passe sous les 500 €, et la sublime édition <strong>Dragon Ball Z</strong> perd carrément <strong>100 €</strong>. Si vous passez 8h par jour assis, c'est un investissement médical et confort autant qu'esthétique.</div>

      <title>9 pouces, 165 Hz, puce de PC de bureau  la fiche technique de la console-PC Ayaneo Next 2 est absurde</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<div class="chapo has-text-weight-semibold mb-5">
<div>La course à la puissance ne s'arrête jamais. Alors que GPD et OneXPlayer misent sur des batteries externes pour alimenter la monstrueuse puce <strong>AMD Strix Halo</strong>, Ayaneo choisit une autre voie. Avec sa <strong>Next 2</strong>, la marque promet d'intégrer cette puissance brute dans un châssis tout-en-un doté d'un écran <strong>165 Hz</strong>. Le résultat risque d'être lourd. Très lourd.</div>

<div>Si vous cherchiez un signe pour passer au solaire, le voilà. Le kit <strong>Zendure Hyper 2000</strong> complet (on parle bien de la totale  onduleur, batterie 2 kWh ET 4 panneaux) s'effondre à <strong>811 €</strong>.
