Prior to versions 2.17.3 and 2.18.3, an Arbitrary File Read vulnerability has been identified in KEDA, potentially affecting any KEDA resource that uses TriggerAuthentication to configure HashiCorp Vault authentication. The vulnerability stems from an incorrect or insufficient path validation when loading the Service Account Token specified in spec.hashiCorpVault.credential.serviceAccount. An attacker with permissions to create or modify a TriggerAuthentication resource can exfiltrate the content of any file from the node's filesystem (where the KEDA pod resides) by directing the file's content to a server under their control, as part of the Vault authentication request.

The issue occurs because usbhs_sys_function_pullup(), which accesses the IP
registers, is executed after the USBHS clocks have been disabled. The
problem is reproducible on the Renesas RZ/G3S SoC starting with the
addition of module stop in the clock enable/disable APIs. With module stop
functionality enabled, a bus error is expected if a master accesses a
module whose clock has been stopped and module stop activated.

Disable the IP clocks at the end of remove. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>

      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

tracing Fix WARN_ON in tracing_buffers_mmap_close for split VMAs

When a VMA is split (e.g., by partial munmap or MAP_FIXED), the kernel
calls vm_ops->close on each portion. For trace buffer mappings, this
results in ring_buffer_unmap() being called multiple times while
ring_buffer_map() was only called once.

This causes ring_buffer_unmap() to return -ENODEV on subsequent calls
because user_mapped is already 0, triggering a WARN_ON.

Trace buffer mappings cannot support partial mappings because the ring
buffer structure requires the complete buffer including the meta page.

Fix this by adding a may_split callback that returns -EINVAL to prevent
VMA splits entirely. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>

      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

usb uas fix urb unmapping issue when the uas device is remove during ongoing data transfer

When a UAS device is unplugged during data transfer, there is
a probability of a system panic occurring. The root cause is
an access to an invalid memory address during URB callback handling.
Specifically, this happens when the dma_direct_unmap_sg() function
is called within the usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() interface, but the
sg->dma_address field is 0 and the sg data structure has already been
freed.

The SCSI driver sends transfer commands by invoking uas_queuecommand_lck()
in uas.c, using the uas_submit_urbs() function to submit requests to USB.
Within the uas_submit_urbs() implementation, three URBs (sense_urb,
data_urb, and cmd_urb) are sequentially submitted. Device removal may
occur at any point during uas_submit_urbs execution, which may result
in URB submission failure. However, some URBs might have been successfully
submitted before the failure, and uas_submit_urbs will return the -ENODEV
error code in this case. The current error handling directly calls
scsi_done(). In the SCSI driver, this eventually triggers scsi_complete()
to invoke scsi_end_request() for releasing the sgtable. The successfully
submitted URBs, when being unlinked to giveback, call
usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() in hcd.c, leading to exceptions during sg
unmapping operations since the sg data structure has already been freed.

This patch modifies the error condition check in the uas_submit_urbs()
function. When a UAS device is removed but one or more URBs have already
been successfully submitted to USB, it avoids immediately invoking
scsi_done() and save the cmnd to devinfo->cmnd array. If the successfully
submitted URBs is completed before devinfo->resetting being set, then
the scsi_done() function will be called within uas_try_complete() after
all pending URB operations are finalized. Otherwise, the scsi_done()
function will be called within uas_zap_pending(), which is executed after
usb_kill_anchored_urbs().

The error handling only takes effect when uas_queuecommand_lck() calls
uas_submit_urbs() and returns the error value -ENODEV . In this case,
the device is disconnected, and the flow proceeds to uas_disconnect(),
where uas_zap_pending() is invoked to call uas_try_complete(). | Severity UNKNOWN</description>

      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

comedi c6xdigio Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration

The Comedi low-level driver "c6xdigio" seems to be for a parallel port
connected device.  When the Comedi core calls the driver's Comedi
"attach" handler `c6xdigio_attach()` to configure a Comedi to use this
driver, it tries to enable the parallel port PNP resources by
registering a PNP driver with `pnp_register_driver()`, but ignores the
return value.  (The `struct pnp_driver` it uses has only the `name` and
`id_table` members filled in.)  The driver's Comedi "detach" handler
`c6xdigio_detach()` unconditionally unregisters the PNP driver with
`pnp_unregister_driver()`.

It is possible for `c6xdigio_attach()` to return an error before it
calls `pnp_register_driver()` and it is possible for the call to
`pnp_register_driver()` to return an error (that is ignored).  In both
cases, the driver should not be calling `pnp_unregister_driver()` as it
does in `c6xdigio_detach()`.  (Note that `c6xdigio_detach()` will be
called by the Comedi core if `c6xdigio_attach()` returns an error, or if
the Comedi core decides to detach the Comedi device from the driver for
some other reason.)

The unconditional call to `pnp_unregister_driver()` without a previous
successful call to `pnp_register_driver()` will cause
`driver_unregister()` to issue a warning "Unexpected driver
unregister!".  This was detected by Syzbot [1].

Also, the PNP driver registration and unregistration should be done at
module init and exit time, respectively, not when attaching or detaching
Comedi devices to the driver.  (There might be more than one Comedi
device being attached to the driver, although that is unlikely.)

Change the driver to do the PNP driver registration at module init time,
and the unregistration at module exit time.  Since `c6xdigio_detach()`
now only calls `comedi_legacy_detach()`, remove the function and change
the Comedi driver "detach" handler to `comedi_legacy_detach`.

comedi pcl818 fix null-ptr-deref in pcl818_ai_cancel()

Syzbot identified an issue [1] in pcl818_ai_cancel(), which stems from
the fact that in case of early device detach via pcl818_detach(),
subdevice dev->read_subdev may not have initialized its pointer to
struct comedi_async as intended. Thus, any such dereferencing of
s->async->cmd will lead to general protection fault and kernel crash.

Mitigate this problem by removing a call to pcl818_ai_cancel() from
pcl818_detach() altogether. This way, if the subdevice setups its
support for async commands, everything async-related will be
handled via subdevice's own ->cancel() function in
comedi_device_detach_locked() even before pcl818_detach(). If no
support for asynchronous commands is provided, there is no need
to cancel anything either.

The above issue occurs with us in errors=continue mode when accompanied by
storage failures. There have been many inconsistencies in the file system
data.
In the case of file system data inconsistency, for example, if the block
bitmap of a referenced block is not set, it can lead to the situation where
a block being committed is allocated and used again. As a result, the
following condition will not be satisfied then trigger BUG_ON. Of course,
it is entirely possible to construct a problematic image that can trigger
this BUG_ON through specific operations. In fact, I have constructed such
an image and easily reproduced this issue.
Therefore, J_ASSERT() holds true only under ideal conditions, but it may
not necessarily be satisfied in exceptional scenarios. Using J_ASSERT()
directly in abnormal situations would cause the system to crash, which is
clearly not what we want. So here we directly trigger a JBD abort instead
of immediately invoking BUG_ON. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>

This can be exploited to delete protected system folders such as C\\Config.msi and subsequently achieve execution as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM via MSI rollback techniques. | Severity UNKNOWN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </description>

Une fuite massive concernant le film Avengers Doomsday affole la toile. Le teaser suggère que Marvel Studios s'apprête à réinterpréter la fin d'Endgame. Mais au-delà du fan-service, le retour d'un super-héros adoré des fans pourrait finalement être le prélude à des temps très sombres pour le MCU.</description>

Versions starting with 0.211.0 and prior to 1.120.4, 1.121.1, and 1.122.0 contain a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in their workflow expression evaluation system. Under certain conditions, expressions supplied by authenticated users during workflow configuration may be evaluated in an execution context that is not sufficiently isolated from the underlying runtime. An authenticated attacker could abuse this behavior to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the n8n process. Successful exploitation may lead to full compromise of the affected instance, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of workflows, and execution of system-level operations. This issue has been fixed in versions 1.120.4, 1.121.1, and 1.122.0. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to a patched version, which introduces additional safeguards to restrict expression evaluation. If upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should consider the following temporary mitigations Limit workflow creation and editing permissions to fully trusted users only and/or deploy n8n in a hardened environment with restricted operating system privileges and network access to reduce the impact of potential exploitation. These workarounds do not fully eliminate the risk and should only be used as short-term measures. | CVSS Score 9.9 (CRITICAL)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </description>

Prior to version 15.0.2, the OAuth login state tokens are completely stateless and carry no per-request entropy or any data that could link them to the session that initiated the OAuth flow. `generate_state_token()` is always called with an empty `state_data` dict, so the resulting JWT only contains the fixed audience claim plus an expiration timestamp. On callback, the library merely checks that the JWT verifies under `state_secret` and is unexpired there is no attempt to match the state value to the browser that initiated the OAuth request, no correlation cookie, and no server-side cache. Any attacker can hit `/authorize`, capture the server-generated state, finish the upstream OAuth flow with their own provider account, and then trick a victim into loading `.../callback?code=attacker_code>state=attacker_state>`. Because the state JWT is valid for any client for \~1 hour, the victim’s browser will complete the flow. This leads to login CSRF. Depending on the app’s logic, the login CSRF can lead to an account takeover of the victim account or to the victim user getting logged in to the attacker's account. Version 15.0.2 contains a patch for the issue. | CVSS Score 5.9 (MEDIUM)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </description>

The application allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript via `javascript`. An attacker can exploit this to inject a malicious Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configuration, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the victim's machine when the node is clicked.

On HTML elements handled by Orejime prior to version 2.3.2, one could run malicious code by embedding `javascript` code within data attributes. When consenting to the related purpose, Orejime would turn data attributes into unprefixed ones (i.e. `data-href` into `href`), thus executing the code. This shouldn't have any impact on most setups, as elements handled by Orejime are generally hardcoded. The problem would only arise if somebody could inject HTML code within pages. The problem has been patched in version 2.3.2. As a workaround, the problem can be fixed outside of Orejime by sanitizing attributes which could contain executable code. | Severity UNKNOWN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </description>

      <title>CVE-2025-68477 Langflow is a tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. Prior to version 1.7....</title>
      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[Langflow is a tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. Prior to version 1.7.0, Langflow provides an API Request component that can issue arbitrary HTTP requests within a flow. This component takes a user-supplied URL, performs only normalization and basic format checks, and then sends the request using a server-side httpx client. It does not block private IP ranges (127[.]0[.]0[.]1, the 10/172/192 ranges) or cloud metadata endpoints (169[.]254[.]169[.]254), and it returns the response body as the result. Because the flow execution endpoints (/api/v1/run, /api/v1/run/advanced) can be invoked with just an API key, if an attacker can control the API Request URL in a flow, non-blind SSRF is possible—accessing internal resources from the server’s network context. This enables requests to, and collection of responses from, internal administrative endpoints, metadata services, and internal databases/services, leading to information disclosure and providing a foothold for further attacks. Version 1.7.0 contains a patch for this issue. | CVSS Score 7.7 (HIGH)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </description>
