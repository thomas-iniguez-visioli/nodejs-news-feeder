<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 21 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Certain build processes for libuv and Node.js for 32-bit systems, such as for the nodejs binary package through nodejs_20.19.0+dfsg-1_i386.deb for Debian GNU/Linux, have an inconsistent off_t size (e.g., building on i386 Debian always uses _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 for the libuv dynamic library, but uses the _FILE_OFFSET_BITS global system default of 32 for nodejs), leading to out-of-bounds access. NOTE: this is not a problem in the Node.js software itself. In particular, the Node.js website's download page does not offer prebuilt Node.js for Linux on i386.

      <title>CVE-2025-4143 - Cloudflare Workers-OAuth-Provider OAuth Redirect URI Validation Bypass</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-4143
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 33 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The OAuth implementation in workers-oauth-provider that is part of  MCP framework https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp , did not correctly validate that redirect_uri was on the allowed list of redirect URIs for the given client registration.

Fixed in:  https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26 

Impact:

 

Under certain circumstances (see below), if a victim had previously authorized with a server built on workers-oath-provider, and an attacker could later trick the victim into visiting a malicious web site, then attacker could potentially steal the victim's credentials to the same OAuth server and subsequently impersonate them.

In order for the attack to be possible, the OAuth server's authorized callback must be designed to auto-approve authorizations that appear to come from an OAuth client that the victim has authorized previously. The authorization flow is not implemented by workers-oauth-provider; it is up to the application built on top to decide whether to implement such automatic re-authorization. However, many applications do implement such logic.

Note: It is a basic, well-known requirement that OAuth servers should verify that the redirect URI is among the allowed list for the client, both during the authorization flow and subsequently when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. workers-oauth-provider implemented only the latter check, not the former. Unfortunately, the former is the much more important check. Readers who are familiar with OAuth may recognize that failing to check redirect URIs against the allowed list is a well-known, basic mistake, covered extensively in the RFC and elsewhere. The author of this library would like everyone to know that he was, in fact, well-aware of this requirement, thought about it a lot while designing the library, and then, somehow, forgot to actually make sure the check was in the code. That is, it's not that he didn't know what he was doing, it's that he knew what he was doing but flubbed it.

      <title>CVE-2025-4144 - Cloudflare Workers-Oauth-Provider PKCE Bypass</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-4144
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 33 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>PKCE was implemented in the OAuth implementation in workers-oauth-provider that is part of  MCP framework https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp . However, it was found that an attacker could cause the check to be skipped.


Fixed in:

 

 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 


Impact: 

PKCE is a defense-in-depth mechanism against certain kinds of attacks and was an optional extension in OAuth 2.0 which became required in the OAuth 2.1 draft. (Note that the MCP specification requires OAuth 2.1.). This bug completely bypasses PKCE protection.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-24887
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 19 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>OpenCTI is an open-source cyber threat intelligence platform. In versions starting from 6.4.8 to before 6.4.10, the allow/deny lists can be bypassed, allowing a user to change attributes that are intended to be unmodifiable by the user. It is possible to toggle the `external` flag on/off and change the own token value for a user. It is also possible to edit attributes that are not in the allow list, such as `otp_qr` and `otp_activated`. If external users exist in the OpenCTI setup and the information about these users identities is sensitive, the above vulnerabilities can be used to enumerate existing user accounts as a standard low privileged user. This issue has been patched in version 6.4.10.

      <title>CVE-2025-32777 - Kubernetes Volcano Denial of Service and Privilege Escalation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32777
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 19 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Volcano is a Kubernetes-native batch scheduling system. Prior to versions 1.11.2, 1.10.2, 1.9.1, 1.11.0-network-topology-preview.3, and 1.12.0-alpha.2, attacker compromise of either the Elastic service or the extender plugin can cause denial of service of the scheduler. This is a privilege escalation, because Volcano users may run their Elastic service and extender plugins in separate pods or nodes from the scheduler. In the Kubernetes security model, node isolation is a security boundary, and as such an attacker is able to cross that boundary in Volcano's case if they have compromised either the vulnerable services or the pod/node in which they are deployed. The scheduler will become unavailable to other users and workloads in the cluster. The scheduler will either crash with an unrecoverable OOM panic or freeze while consuming excessive amounts of memory. This issue has been patched in versions 1.11.2, 1.10.2, 1.9.1, 1.11.0-network-topology-preview.3, and 1.12.0-alpha.2.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46557
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 18 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 15.3-rc-1 to before 15.10.14, from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.6, and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.10.0-rc-1, a user who can access pages located in the XWiki space (by default, anyone) can access the page XWiki.Authentication.Administration and (unless an authenticator is set in xwiki.cfg) switch to another installed authenticator. Note that, by default, there is only one authenticator available (Standard XWiki Authenticator). So, if no authenticator extension was installed, it's not really possible to do anything for an attacker. Also, in most cases, if an SSO authenticator is installed and utilized (like OIDC or LDAP for example), the worst an attacker can do is break authentication by switching back to the standard authenticator (that's because it's impossible to login to a user which does not have a stored password, and that's usually what SSO authenticator produce). This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.14, 16.4.6, and 16.10.0-rc-1.

<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 23 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 4.5.1 to before 15.10.13, from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.4, and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1, the Solr script service doesn't take dropped programming rights into account. The Solr script service that is accessible in XWiki's scripting API normally requires programming rights to be called. Due to using the wrong API for checking rights, it doesn't take the fact into account that programming rights might have been dropped by calling `$xcontext.dropPermissions()`. If some code relies on this for the safety of executing Velocity code with the wrong author context, this could allow a user with script rights to either cause a high load by indexing documents or to temporarily remove documents from the search index. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.13, 16.4.4, and 16.8.0-rc-1.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 6.1-milestone-1 to before 15.10.12, from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.3, and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1, the script API of the LESS compiler in XWiki is incorrectly checking for rights when calling the cache cleaning API, making it possible to clean the cache without having programming right. The only impact of this is a slowdown in XWiki execution as the caches are re-filled. As this vulnerability requires script right to exploit, and script right already allows unlimited execution of scripts, the additional impact due to this vulnerability is low. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.12, 16.4.3, and 16.8.0-rc-1.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 15.9-rc-1 to before 15.10.12, from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.3, and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1, when a user with programming rights edits a document in XWiki that was last edited by a user without programming rights and contains an XWiki.ComponentClass, there is no warning that this will grant programming rights to this object. An attacker who created such a malicious object could use this to gain programming rights on the wiki. For this, the attacker needs to have edit rights on at least one page to place this object and then get an admin user to edit that document. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.12, 16.4.3, and 16.8.0-rc-1.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 23 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 15.9-rc-1 to before 15.10.8 and from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.2.0, the required rights analysis doesn't consider TextAreas with default content type. When editing a page, XWiki warns since version 15.9 when there is content on the page like a script macro that would gain more rights due to the editing. This analysis doesn't consider certain kinds of properties, allowing a user to put malicious scripts in there that will be executed after a user with script, admin, or programming rights edited the page. Such a malicious script could impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.8 and 16.2.0.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46342
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 23 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. Prior to versions 1.13.5 and 1.14.0, it may happen that policy rules using namespace selector(s) in their match statements are mistakenly not applied during admission review request processing due to a missing error propagation in function `GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister` in `pkg/utils/engine/labels.go`. As a consequence, security-critical mutations and validations are bypassed, potentially allowing attackers with K8s API access to perform malicious operations. This issue has been patched in versions 1.13.5 and 1.14.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-27409 - Joplin Server Path Traversal Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-27409
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. Prior to version 3.3.3, path traversal is possible in Joplin Server if static file path starts with `css/pluginAssets` or `js/pluginAssets`. The `findLocalFile` function in the `default route` calls `localFileFromUrl` to check for special `pluginAssets` paths. If the function returns a path, the result is returned directly, without checking for path traversal. The vulnerability allows attackers to read files outside the intended directories. This issue has been patched in version 3.3.3.
<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 7.5 | HIGH

      <title>CVE-2025-30202 - vLLM ZeroMQ Denial of Service and Data Exposure Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30202
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Versions starting from 0.5.2 and prior to 0.8.5 are vulnerable to denial of service and data exposure via ZeroMQ on multi-node vLLM deployment. In a multi-node vLLM deployment, vLLM uses ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes. The primary vLLM host opens an XPUB ZeroMQ socket and binds it to ALL interfaces. While the socket is always opened for a multi-node deployment, it is only used when doing tensor parallelism across multiple hosts. Any client with network access to this host can connect to this XPUB socket unless its port is blocked by a firewall. Once connected, these arbitrary clients will receive all of the same data broadcasted to all of the secondary vLLM hosts. This data is internal vLLM state information that is not useful to an attacker. By potentially connecting to this socket many times and not reading data published to them, an attacker can also cause a denial of service by slowing down or potentially blocking the publisher. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.

      <title>CVE-2025-32444 - "vLLM Mooncake ZeroMQ Remote Code Execution"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32444
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Versions starting from 0.6.5 and prior to 0.8.5, having vLLM integration with mooncake, are vulnerable to remote code execution due to using pickle based serialization over unsecured ZeroMQ sockets. The vulnerable sockets were set to listen on all network interfaces, increasing the likelihood that an attacker is able to reach the vulnerable ZeroMQ sockets to carry out an attack. vLLM instances that do not make use of the mooncake integration are not vulnerable. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46560
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Versions starting from 0.8.0 and prior to 0.8.5 are affected by a critical performance vulnerability in the input preprocessing logic of the multimodal tokenizer. The code dynamically replaces placeholder tokens (e.g., <|audio_|>, <|image_|>) with repeated tokens based on precomputed lengths. Due to ​​inefficient list concatenation operations​​, the algorithm exhibits ​​quadratic time complexity (O(n²))​​, allowing malicious actors to trigger resource exhaustion via specially crafted inputs. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46346
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 29, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. Prior to version 4.5.4, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the application’s comments feature. This issue allows a malicious actor to inject JavaScript payloads that are stored and later executed in the browser of any user viewing the affected comment. The XSS occurs because the application fails to properly sanitize or encode user input submitted to the comments. Notably, the application sanitizes or does not allow execution of `<script>` tags, but does not account for payloads obfuscated using JavaScript block comments like `/* JavaScriptPayload */`. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.4.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 29, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 14 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Mozilla Firefox's update mechanism allowed a medium-integrity user process to interfere with the SYSTEM-level updater by manipulating the file-locking behavior. By injecting code into the user-privileged process, an attacker could bypass intended access controls, allowing SYSTEM-level file operations on paths controlled by a non-privileged user and enabling privilege escalation.

Prior to version 2.21.0, an improper input handling vulnerability in the `/api/upload` endpoint allows an attacker to perform a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by submitting malicious payloads in the `libraryId` field. The unsanitized input is reflected in the server’s error message, enabling arbitrary JavaScript execution in a victim's browser. This issue has been patched in version 2.21.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-46343 - n8n Stored XSS Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46343
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 29, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 7 hours, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>n8n is a workflow automation platform. Prior to version 1.90.0, n8n is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) through the attachments view endpoint. n8n workflows can store and serve binary files, which are accessible to authenticated users. However, there is no restriction on the MIME type of uploaded files, and the MIME type could be controlled via a GET parameter. This allows the server to respond with any MIME type, potentially enabling malicious content to be interpreted and executed by the browser. An authenticated attacker with member-level permissions could exploit this by uploading a crafted HTML file containing malicious JavaScript. When another user visits the binary data endpoint with the MIME type set to text/html, the script executes in the context of the user’s session. This script could send a request to change the user’s email address in their account settings, effectively enabling account takeover. This issue has been patched in version 1.90.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-46326 - Snowflake-Connector-Net TOCTOU Race Condition Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46326
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 28, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>snowflake-connector-net is the Snowflake Connector for .NET. Versions starting from 2.1.2 to before 4.4.1, are vulnerable to a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition. When using the Easy Logging feature on Linux and macOS, the Connector reads logging configuration from a user-provided file. On Linux and macOS, the Connector verifies that the configuration file can be written to only by its owner. That check was vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition and failed to verify that the file owner matches the user running the Connector. This could allow a local attacker with write access to the configuration file or the directory containing it to overwrite the configuration and gain control over logging level and output location. This issue has been patched in version 4.4.1.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3224
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 28, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in the update process of Docker Desktop for Windows versions prior to 4.41.0 could allow a local, low-privileged attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM. During an update, Docker Desktop attempts to delete files and subdirectories under the path C:\ProgramData\Docker\config with high privileges. However, this directory often does not exist by default, and C:\ProgramData\ allows normal users to create new directories. By creating a malicious Docker\config folder structure at this location, an attacker can force the privileged update process to delete or manipulate arbitrary system files, leading to Elevation of Privilege.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-43857
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 28, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 26 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Net::IMAP implements Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) client functionality in Ruby. Prior to versions 0.5.7, 0.4.20, 0.3.9, and 0.2.5, there is a possibility for denial of service by memory exhaustion when net-imap reads server responses. At any time while the client is connected, a malicious server can send can send a "literal" byte count, which is automatically read by the client's receiver thread. The response reader immediately allocates memory for the number of bytes indicated by the server response. This should not be an issue when securely connecting to trusted IMAP servers that are well-behaved. It can affect insecure connections and buggy, untrusted, or compromised servers (for example, connecting to a user supplied hostname). This issue has been patched in versions 0.5.7, 0.4.20, 0.3.9, and 0.2.5.

<p>Les « parcours de cybersécurité » avaient pour objectif d’élever la sécurité numérique des services publics, de dynamiser l’industrie de cybersécurité française et européenne et de favoriser des investissements durables au service de la cybersécurité des organisations.</p>
<p>Pendant 4 ans, l’ANSSI a conçu, déployé et piloté un dispositif d’accompagnement au profit des collectivités, des établissements de santé et des entités publiques. Ainsi, 945 entités parmi les plus vulnérables à la menace cyber ont pu bénéficier de cet accompagnement, dont :</p>
<ul><li>707 collectivités territoriales,</li>
<li>134 établissements de santé,</li>
<li>87 autres établissements publics,</li>
<li>17 centres de recherche et d’enseignement supérieur,</li>
</ul><p>Parmi celles-ci, 62 entités ont été accompagnées dans les territoires d’Outre-mer.</p>
<p>Les parcours ont permis d’élever le niveau de cyberdéfense des bénéficiaires de manière significative : en moyenne, les bénéficiaires sont passés d’un score de maturité cyber de D+ à B, soulignant un progrès conséquent. Grâce aux parcours, les entités ont réussi à s’intégrer dans l’écosystème cyber de leur territoire et de leur secteur, en lien avec l’ANSSI, et sont ainsi solidement ancrées dans une démarche de sécurisation à long terme.</p>
<p>Au-delà des bénéfices pour les entités accompagnées, les parcours de cybersécurité laissent un héritage exploitable dans la durée, notamment dans la perspective de la mise en œuvre de la directive NIS 2 avec la mise à disposition d’outils et de méthodes adaptés aux besoins de chaque bénéficiaire.</p>
<p>Le programme a permis de dynamiser l’offre industrielle de cybersécurité dans les territoires et de renforcer l’offre française et européenne de cybersécurité :</p>
<ul><li>197 prestataires présents sur l’ensemble du territoire national ont été impliqués.</li>
<li>40 millions d’euros ont été dédiés à l’acquisition de produits de cybersécurité français et européens (dont 33 millions d’euros pour des produits français).</li>
</ul><p>Les parcours de cybersécurité sont un succès, avec des effets tangibles et durables pour les bénéficiaires. Ils font partie d'un programme plus large de soutien à la transformation numérique et à la résilience des systèmes d'information, dans un contexte où les cybermenaces se multiplient.</p>

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Formidable (aka node-formidable) 2.1.0 through 3.x before 3.5.3 relies on hexoid to prevent guessing of filenames for untrusted executable content; however, hexoid is documented as not "cryptographically secure." (Also, there is a scenario in which only the last two characters of a hexoid string need to be guessed, but this is not often relevant.) NOTE: this does not imply that, in a typical use case, attackers will be able to exploit any hexoid behavior to upload and execute their own content.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-2105
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 26, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 20 hours, 5 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Jupiter X Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.11 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'file' parameter of the 'raven_download_file' function. This makes it possible for attackers to inject a PHP Object through a PHAR file. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. This vulnerability may be exploited by unauthenticated attackers when a form is present on the site with the file download action, and the ability to upload files is also present. Otherwise, this would be considered exploitable by Contributor-level users and above, because they could create the form needed to successfully exploit this.

      <title>CVE-2025-46333 - Z2D Stride Compositor Out-of-Bounds Write</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46333
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 25, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 1 day, 2 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>z2d is a pure Zig 2D graphics library. In version 0.6.0, when writing from one surface to another using `z2d.compositor.StrideCompositor.run`, the source surface can be completely out-of-bounds on the x-axis (but not on the y-axis) by way of a negative offset. This results in an overflow of the value controlling the length of the stride. In non-safe optimization modes (consumers compiling with `ReleaseFast` or `ReleaseSmall`), this could potentially lead to invalid memory accesses or corruption. This issue is patched in version 0.6.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-3935 - ScreenConnect ASP.NET ViewState Code Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3935
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 25, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 18 hours, 27 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ScreenConnect versions 25.2.3 and earlier versions may be susceptible to a ViewState code injection attack. ASP.NET Web Forms use ViewState to preserve page and control state, with data encoded using Base64 protected by machine keys. 
It is important to note that to obtain these machine keys, privileged system level access must be obtained. 



If these machine keys are compromised, attackers could create and send a malicious ViewState to the website, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server. 



The risk does not originate from a vulnerability introduced by ScreenConnect, but from platform level behavior.  This had no direct impact to ScreenConnect Client. ScreenConnect 2025.4 patch disables ViewState and removes any dependency on it.

<strong>Published : </strong> April 25, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 15 hours, 2 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 0.6.12, a normal user is able to access and modify APP orchestration, even though the web UI of APP orchestration is not presented for a normal user. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to make unauthorized access and changes on the APPSs. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can access Orchestration of the APPs.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 25, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 8 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An XSS issue was discovered in the Flag module before 1.x-3.6.2 for Backdrop CMS. Flag is a module that allows flags to be added to nodes, comments, users, and any other type of entity.

This is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with permission to create links on the website, for example: create or edit comments or content with a filtered text format.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>React Router is a router for React. Starting in version 7.2.0 and prior to version 7.5.2, it is possible to force an application to switch to SPA mode by adding a header to the request.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>h11 is a Python implementation of HTTP/1.1. Prior to version 0.16.0, a leniency in h11's parsing of line terminators in chunked-coding message bodies can lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities under certain conditions. This issue has been patched in version 0.16.0. Since exploitation requires the combination of buggy h11 with a buggy (reverse) proxy, fixing either component is sufficient to mitigate this issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-21605 - Redis Unauthenticated Output Buffer Overflow Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21605
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 23, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In versions starting at 2.6 and prior to 7.4.3, An unauthenticated client can cause unlimited growth of output buffers, until the server runs out of memory or is killed. By default, the Redis configuration does not limit the output buffer of normal clients (see client-output-buffer-limit). Therefore, the output buffer can grow unlimitedly over time. As a result, the service is exhausted and the memory is unavailable. When password authentication is enabled on the Redis server, but no password is provided, the client can still cause the output buffer to grow from "NOAUTH" responses until the system will run out of memory. This issue has been patched in version 7.4.3. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways. Either using network access control tools like firewalls, iptables, security groups, etc, or enabling TLS and requiring users to authenticate using client side certificates.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32968
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 23, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 1.6-milestone-1 to before 15.10.16, 16.4.6, and 16.10.1, it is possible for a user with SCRIPT right to escape from the HQL execution context and perform a blind SQL injection to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the database backend. Depending on the used database backend, the attacker may be able to not only obtain confidential information such as password hashes from the database, but also execute UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries. This issue has been patched in versions 16.10.1, 16.4.6 and 15.10.16. There is no known workaround, other than upgrading XWiki. The protection added to this REST API is the same as the one used to validate complete select queries, making it more consistent. However, while the script API always had this protection for complete queries, it's important to note that it's a very strict protection and some valid, but complex, queries might suddenly require the author to have programming right.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-10306
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 23, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 6 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability was found in mod_proxy_cluster. The issue is that the <Directory> directive should be replaced by the <Location> directive as the former does not restrict IP/host access as `Require ip IP_ADDRESS` would suggest. This means that anyone with access to the host might send MCMP requests that may result in adding/removing/updating nodes for the balancing. However, this host should not be accessible to the public network as it does not serve the general traffic.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3530
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 23, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 8 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The WordPress Simple Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to product price manipulation in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.2. This is due to a logic flaw involving the inconsistent use of parameters during the cart addition process. The plugin uses the parameter 'product_tmp_two' for computing a security hash against price tampering while using 'wspsc_product' to display the product, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to substitute details from a cheaper product and bypass payment for a more expensive item.

Versions 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, and 4.2.4 of xrpl.js were compromised and contained malicious code designed to exfiltrate private keys. Version 2.14.2 is also malicious, though it is less likely to lead to exploitation as it is not compatible with other 2.x versions. Anyone who used one of these versions should stop immediately and rotate any private keys or secrets used with affected systems. Users of xrpl.js should pgrade to version 4.2.5 or 2.14.3 to receive a patch. To secure funds, think carefully about whether any keys may have been compromised by this supply chain attack, and mitigate by sending funds to secure wallets, and/or rotating keys. If any account's master key is potentially compromised, disable the key.

      <title>CVE-2025-32955 - Harden-Runner Docker Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32955
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 21, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 19 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Harden-Runner is a CI/CD security agent that works like an EDR for GitHub Actions runners. Versions from 0.12.0 to before 2.12.0 are vulnerable to `disable-sudo` bypass. Harden-Runner includes a policy option `disable-sudo` to prevent the GitHub Actions runner user from using sudo. This is implemented by removing the runner user from the sudoers file. However, this control can be bypassed as the runner user, being part of the docker group, can interact with the Docker daemon to launch privileged containers or access the host filesystem. This allows the attacker to regain root access or restore the sudoers file, effectively bypassing the restriction. This issue has been patched in version 2.12.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-32958 - Adept Language GitHub Token Exposure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32958
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 21, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 19 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Adept is a language for general purpose programming. Prior to commit a1a41b7, the remoteBuild.yml workflow file uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the mac-standalone artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated .git/config file containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the Github API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in the AdeptLanguage/Adept repository. This issue has been patched in commit a1a41b7.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 21, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 7 hours, 18 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Traefik (pronounced traffic) is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. In versions prior to 2.11.24, 3.3.6, and 3.4.0-rc2. There is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing the requests using a PathPrefix, Path or PathRegex matcher. When Traefik is configured to route the requests to a backend using a matcher based on the path, if the URL contains a /../ in its path, it’s possible to target a backend, exposed using another router, by-passing the middlewares chain. This issue has been patched in versions 2.11.24, 3.3.6, and 3.4.0-rc2. A workaround involves adding a `PathRegexp` rule to the matcher to prevent matching a route with a `/../` in the path.

      <title>CVE-2025-29953 - Apache ActiveMQ NMS OpenWire Client Arbitrary Code Execution via Untrusted Deserialization</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-29953
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 18, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ NMS OpenWire Client.

This issue affects Apache ActiveMQ NMS OpenWire Client before 2.1.1 when performing connections to untrusted servers. Such servers could abuse the unbounded deserialization in the client to provide malicious responses that may eventually cause arbitrary code execution on the client. Version 2.1.0 introduced a allow/denylist feature to restrict deserialization, but this feature could be bypassed.

The .NET team has deprecated the built-in .NET binary serialization feature starting with .NET 9 and suggests migrating away from binary serialization. The project is considering to follow suit and drop this part of the NMS API altogether.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.1, which fixes the issue. We also recommend to migrate away from relying on .NET binary serialization as a hardening method for the future.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>NamelessMC is a free, easy to use & powerful website software for Minecraft servers.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 18, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>NamelessMC is a free, easy to use & powerful website software for Minecraft servers. In version 2.1.4 and prior, an insecure view count mechanism in the forum page allows an unauthenticated attacker to artificially increase the view count. The application relies on a client-side cookie (nl-topic-[tid]) (or session variable for guests) to determine if a view should be counted. When a client does not provide the cookie, every page request increments the counter, leading to incorrect view metrics. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32792
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 18, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>SES safely executes third-party JavaScript 'strict' mode programs in compartments that have no excess authority in their global scope. Prior to version 1.12.0, web pages and web extensions using `ses` and the Compartment API to evaluate third-party code in an isolated execution environment that have also elsewhere used `const`, `let`, and `class` bindings in the top-level scope of a `<script>` tag will have inadvertently revealed these bindings in the lexical scope of third-party code. This issue has been patched in version 1.12.0. Workarounds for this issue involve either avoiding top-level `let`, `const`, or `class` bindings in `<script>` tags, or change these to `var` bindings to be reflected on `globalThis`.

<strong>Description : </strong>Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 0.6.12, a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY where normal users are improperly granted permissions to edit APP names, descriptions and icons. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to modify app details, despite being restricted from viewing apps, which poses a security risk to the integrity of the application. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can modify app details.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32796
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 18, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 0.6.12, a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY where normal users can enable or disable apps through the API, even though the web UI button for this action is disabled and normal users are not permitted to make such changes. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to make unauthorized changes, which can disrupt the functionality and availability of the APPS. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the API access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can send enable or disable requests for apps.

      <title>CVE-2025-39735 - Linux Kernel JFS Slab Out-of-Bounds Read Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-39735
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 18, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: fix slab-out-of-bounds read in ea_get()

During the "size_check" label in ea_get(), the code checks if the extended
attribute list (xattr) size matches ea_size. If not, it logs
"ea_get: invalid extended attribute" and calls print_hex_dump().

Here, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr) returns 4110417968, which exceeds
INT_MAX (2,147,483,647). Then ea_size is clamped:

	int size = clamp_t(int, ea_size, 0, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr));

Although clamp_t aims to bound ea_size between 0 and 4110417968, the upper
limit is treated as an int, causing an overflow above 2^31 - 1. This leads
"size" to wrap around and become negative (-184549328).

The "size" is then passed to print_hex_dump() (called "len" in
print_hex_dump()), it is passed as type size_t (an unsigned
type), this is then stored inside a variable called
"int remaining", which is then assigned to "int linelen" which
is then passed to hex_dump_to_buffer(). In print_hex_dump()
the for loop, iterates through 0 to len-1, where len is
18446744073525002176, calling hex_dump_to_buffer()
on each iteration:

	for (i = 0; i < len; i += rowsize) {
		linelen = min(remaining, rowsize);
		remaining -= rowsize;

		hex_dump_to_buffer(ptr + i, linelen, rowsize, groupsize,
				   linebuf, sizeof(linebuf), ascii);

		...
	}

The expected stopping condition (i < len) is effectively broken
since len is corrupted and very large. This eventually leads to
the "ptr+i" being passed to hex_dump_to_buffer() to get closer
to the end of the actual bounds of "ptr", eventually an out of
bounds access is done in hex_dump_to_buffer() in the following
for loop:

	for (j = 0; j < len; j++) {
			if (linebuflen < lx + 2)
				goto overflow2;
			ch = ptr[j];
		...
	}

To fix this we should validate "EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr)"
before it is utilised.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-39989
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 18, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/mce: use is_copy_from_user() to determine copy-from-user context

Patch series "mm/hwpoison: Fix regressions in memory failure handling",
v4.

## 1. What am I trying to do:

This patchset resolves two critical regressions related to memory failure
handling that have appeared in the upstream kernel since version 5.17, as
compared to 5.10 LTS.

    - copyin case: poison found in user page while kernel copying from user space
    - instr case: poison found while instruction fetching in user space

## 2. What is the expected outcome and why

- For copyin case:

Kernel can recover from poison found where kernel is doing get_user() or
copy_from_user() if those places get an error return and the kernel return
-EFAULT to the process instead of crashing.  More specifily, MCE handler
checks the fixup handler type to decide whether an in kernel #MC can be
recovered.  When EX_TYPE_UACCESS is found, the PC jumps to recovery code
specified in _ASM_EXTABLE_FAULT() and return a -EFAULT to user space.

- For instr case:

If a poison found while instruction fetching in user space, full recovery
is possible.  User process takes #PF, Linux allocates a new page and fills
by reading from storage.


## 3. What actually happens and why

- For copyin case: kernel panic since v5.17

Commit 4c132d1d844a ("x86/futex: Remove .fixup usage") introduced a new
extable fixup type, EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG, and later patches updated the
extable fixup type for copy-from-user operations, changing it from
EX_TYPE_UACCESS to EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG.  It breaks previous EX_TYPE_UACCESS
handling when posion found in get_user() or copy_from_user().

- For instr case: user process is killed by a SIGBUS signal due to #CMCI
  and #MCE race

When an uncorrected memory error is consumed there is a race between the
CMCI from the memory controller reporting an uncorrected error with a UCNA
signature, and the core reporting and SRAR signature machine check when
the data is about to be consumed.

### Background: why *UN*corrected errors tied to *C*MCI in Intel platform [1]

Prior to Icelake memory controllers reported patrol scrub events that
detected a previously unseen uncorrected error in memory by signaling a
broadcast machine check with an SRAO (Software Recoverable Action
Optional) signature in the machine check bank.  This was overkill because
it's not an urgent problem that no core is on the verge of consuming that
bad data.  It's also found that multi SRAO UCE may cause nested MCE
interrupts and finally become an IERR.

Hence, Intel downgrades the machine check bank signature of patrol scrub
from SRAO to UCNA (Uncorrected, No Action required), and signal changed to
#CMCI.  Just to add to the confusion, Linux does take an action (in
uc_decode_notifier()) to try to offline the page despite the UC*NA*
signature name.

### Background: why #CMCI and #MCE race when poison is consuming in
    Intel platform [1]

Having decided that CMCI/UCNA is the best action for patrol scrub errors,
the memory controller uses it for reads too.  But the memory controller is
executing asynchronously from the core, and can't tell the difference
between a "real" read and a speculative read.  So it will do CMCI/UCNA if
an error is found in any read.

Thus:

1) Core is clever and thinks address A is needed soon, issues a
   speculative read.

2) Core finds it is going to use address A soon after sending the read
   request

3) The CMCI from the memory controller is in a race with MCE from the
   core that will soon try to retire the load from address A.

Quite often (because speculation has got better) the CMCI from the memory
controller is delivered before the core is committed to the instruction
reading address A, so the interrupt is taken, and Linux offlines the page
(marking it as poison).


## Why user process is killed for instr case

      <title>CVE-2025-40014 - "AMD spi objtool Stack Buffer Overflow"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-40014
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 18, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

objtool, spi: amd: Fix out-of-bounds stack access in amd_set_spi_freq()

If speed_hz < AMD_SPI_MIN_HZ, amd_set_spi_freq() iterates over the
entire amd_spi_freq array without breaking out early, causing 'i' to go
beyond the array bounds.

Fix that by stopping the loop when it gets to the last entry, so the low
speed_hz value gets clamped up to AMD_SPI_MIN_HZ.

Fixes the following warning with an UBSAN kernel:

  drivers/spi/spi-amd.o: error: objtool: amd_set_spi_freq() falls through to next function amd_spi_set_opcode()

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-40114
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 18, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: light: Add check for array bounds in veml6075_read_int_time_ms

The array contains only 5 elements, but the index calculated by
veml6075_read_int_time_index can range from 0 to 7,
which could lead to out-of-bounds access. The check prevents this issue.

Coverity Issue
CID 1574309: (#1 of 1): Out-of-bounds read (OVERRUN)
overrun-local: Overrunning array veml6075_it_ms of 5 4-byte
elements at element index 7 (byte offset 31) using
index int_index (which evaluates to 7)

This is hardening against potentially broken hardware. Good to have
but not necessary to backport.

La menace à l’encontre des entités du secteur cible des entreprises de toute taille, dans le monde entier, et qui ont la gestion d’une large variété de moyen de transports. Répondant à ses missions de connaissance de la menace informatique, l’ANSSI partage un état de la menace sur le secteur du transport urbain.</p>
<h3><strong>Un secteur fortement exposé en 2024</strong></h3>
<p>Tout au long de l’année, le contexte des Jeux Olympiques et Paralympiques de Paris 2024 a mis en lumière l’exposition de ce secteur aux cyberattaques, les tensions géopolitiques ayant été un catalyseur fort de cette menace avec de nombreuses attaques par déni de services.</p>
<p>L’imbrication de plusieurs réseaux informatiques de grande taille ainsi que la diversité des équipements qui les composent met en exergue des niveaux de sécurisation hétérogène complexifiant d’autant plus les questions de sécurité des systèmes d’information et augmentant significativement la surface d’attaque.</p>
<p>Les entités du secteur sont également fortement ciblées en raison du grand nombre de données personnelles des usagers, ainsi une attention toute particulière doit être portée à la protection de ces bases de données qui font régulièrement l’objet d’attaques à des fins d’exfiltration.</p>
<h3><strong>Prévenir et se protéger contre ces menaces</strong></h3>
<p>Dans son état de la menace, l’ANSSI rappelle l’importance d’avoir une approche globale de la sécurité et recommande aux entités de réaliser une cartographie globale des systèmes d’information afin d’identifier les risques affectant l’entité ou encore mesurer la maturité des systèmes d’informations concernés.</p>
<p>Il est essentiel de travailler sur des modes de fonctionnement dégradé notamment pour assurer et préparer en parallèle un <strong>plan de continuité d’activité (PCA)</strong> et un <strong>plan de reprise d’activité (PRA)</strong>. La mise en pratique ces recommandations permettra au secteur des transports urbains d’anticiper ces menaces.</p>

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3578
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 15, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 3 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A malicious, authenticated user in Aidex, versions prior to 1.7, could list credentials of other users, create or modify existing users in the application, list credentials of users in production or development environments. In addition, it would be possible to cause bugs that would result in the exfiltration of sensitive information, such as details about the software or internal system paths. These actions could be carried out through the misuse of LLM Prompt (chatbot) technology, via the /api/<string-chat>/message endpoint, by manipulating the contents of the ‘content’ parameter.

<h3><strong>Les Jeux olympiques et paralympiques de Paris 2024 comme consécration du modèle français de cyberdéfense</strong></h3>
<p>En tant que cheffe de file du volet cyber, l’ANSSI a été au cœur de la préparation des Jeux olympiques et paralympiques de Paris 2024. Le succès de cet événement international majeur est un accomplissement pour l’Agence, qui témoigne également de la pertinence du modèle de cyberdéfense français bâti autour d’une autorité nationale et ancré dans un écosystème élargi et déployé dans les territoires. Les Jeux sont le résultat d’une méthode – anticipation, préparation, entraînement – et d’une équipe – l’écosystème cyber public et privé – qui doivent perdurer pour<strong> permettre à la France de rester parmi les grandes nations de la cybersécurité.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>La directive NIS 2, vecteur d’une transformation profonde pour l’ANSSI</strong></h3>
<p>En 2024, l’ANSSI a poursuivi ses travaux de transposition de la directive NIS 2 qui sont le moteur d’un changement majeur de son organisation, de ses méthodes et de sa manière d’interagir avec ses bénéficiaires et ses partenaires. Déjà fortement mobilisées sur le sujet au cours des dernières années, les équipes de l’Agence continueront de l’être au quotidien, en coordination avec l’écosystème cyber, pour accompagner des milliers d’entités dans leur cybersécurité.</p>
<h3><strong>Des progrès précieux pour l’élévation générale de la cybersécurité de l’Union européenne</strong></h3>
<p>À l’image du cadre réglementaire défini par NIS 2, ou encore du vote du règlement sur la résilience cyber, pour lesquels l’ANSSI s’est pleinement engagée, la cybersécurité en Europe a connu de belles avancées en 2024. Par ailleurs, face aux évolutions technologiques, et notamment aux technologies de rupture, la conservation d’une maîtrise souveraine des expertises techniques s’impose comme une mission essentielle de l’ANSSI.</p>
<h4><strong>L’année 2024 en quelques chiffres :</strong></h4>
<ul><li><strong>656 </strong>agents âgés en moyenne de <strong>36 </strong>ans, œuvrent au quotidien pour la cybersécurité de la Nation, au sein de l’ANSSI.</li>
<li><strong>4 386 (+15%)</strong> événements de sécurité traités par l’ANSSI, et <strong>1 361 (+18%)</strong> incidents ayant impliqué un acteur malveillant.</li>
<li><strong>68</strong> formations labellisées SecNumedu, <strong>1 696</strong> personnes formées au Centre de formation à la sécurité des systèmes d’information (CFSSI) et <strong>117 856</strong> attestations SecNumacadémie décernées.</li>
</ul><h4><strong>L’année 2024 en quelques dates clés :</strong></h4>
<p>Au-delà des JOP24 d’autres d’événements ont marqué l’année 2024 :</p>
<ul><li><strong>31 janvier</strong> : Adoption du schéma européen de certification de cybersécurité fondé sur des critères commun.</li>
<li><strong>10 mai </strong>: Entrée en vigueur du décret d’application de la loi de programmation militaire 2024-2030, permettant à l’ANSSI de mettre en œuvre l’ensemble des nouvelles capacités dont elle l’a dotée.</li>
<li><strong>9 juillet </strong>: Publications des recommandations de l’ANSSI pour l’hébergement des systèmes d’information sensible dans le cloud.</li>
<li><strong>15 octobre </strong>: Présentation en conseil des ministres du projet de loi relatif à la résilience des activités d’importance vitale, à la protection des infrastructures critiques à la cybersécurité et à la résilience opérationnelle du secteur financier dont le titre II, Cybersécurité, vise à transposer la directive NIS 2.</li>

      <title>CVE-2025-31491 - "AutoGPT Cross-Domain Cookie and Header Leakage Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-31491
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 15, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 6 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to 0.6.1, AutoGPT allows of leakage of cross-domain cookies and protected headers in requests redirect. AutoGPT uses a wrapper around the requests python library, located in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. In this wrapper, redirects are specifically NOT followed for the first request. If the wrapper is used with allow_redirects set to True (which is the default), any redirect is not followed by the initial request, but rather re-requested by the wrapper using the new location. However, there is a fundamental flaw in manually re-requesting the new location: it does not account for security-sensitive headers which should not be sent cross-origin, such as the Authorization and Proxy-Authorization header, and cookies. For example in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/blocks/github/_api.py, an Authorization header is set when retrieving data from the GitHub API. However, if GitHub suffers from an open redirect vulnerability (such as the made-up example of https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment_id}/../../../../../redirect/?url=https://joshua.hu/), and the script can be coerced into visiting it with the Authorization header, the GitHub credentials in the Authorization header will be leaked. This allows leaking auth headers and private cookies. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-31494 - AutoGPT WebSocket API Graph ID Spoofing Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-31494
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 15, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 6 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. The AutoGPT Platform's WebSocket API transmitted node execution updates to subscribers based on the graph_id+graph_version. Additionally, there was no check prohibiting users from subscribing with another user's graph_id+graph_version. As a result, node execution updates from one user's graph execution could be received by another user within the same instance. This vulnerability does not occur between different instances or between users and non-users of the platform. Single-user instances are not affected. In private instances with a user white-list, the impact is limited by the fact that all potential unintended recipients of these node execution updates must have been admitted by the administrator. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-31490 - AutoGPT SSRF via DNS Rebinding</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-31490
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 14, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 7 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to 0.6.1, AutoGPT allows SSRF due to DNS Rebinding in requests wrapper. AutoGPT is built with a wrapper around Python's requests library, hardening the application against SSRF. The code for this wrapper can be found in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. The requested hostname of a URL which is being requested is validated, ensuring that it does not resolve to any local ipv4 or ipv6 addresses. However, this check is not sufficient, as a DNS server may initially respond with a non-blocked address, with a TTL of 0. This means that the initial resolution would appear as a non-blocked address. In this case, validate_url() will return the url as successful. After validate_url() has successfully returned the url, the url is then passed to the real request() function. When the real request() function is called with the validated url, request() will once again resolve the address of the hostname, because the record will not have been cached (due to TTL 0). This resolution may be in the "invalid range". This type of attack is called a "DNS Rebinding Attack". This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-3445 - Apache Archiver Path Traversal Zip Slip Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3445
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 13, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 10 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A Path Traversal "Zip Slip" vulnerability has been identified in mholt/archiver in Go. This vulnerability allows using a crafted ZIP file containing path traversal symlinks to create or overwrite files with the user's privileges or application utilizing the library.

When using the archiver.Unarchive functionality with ZIP files, like this: archiver.Unarchive(zipFile, outputDir),  A crafted ZIP file can be extracted in such a way that it writes files to the affected system with the same privileges as the application executing this vulnerable functionality. Consequently, sensitive files may be overwritten, potentially leading to privilege escalation, code execution, and other severe outcomes in some cases.

It's worth noting that a similar vulnerability was found in TAR files (CVE-2024-0406). Although a fix was implemented, it hasn't been officially released, and the affected project has since been deprecated. The successor to mholt/archiver is a new project called mholt/archives, and its initial release (v0.1.0) removes the Unarchive() functionality.

      <title>CVE-2025-0123 - Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS Unauthorized Access to Decrypted Packet Captures</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-0123
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 11, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 1 day, 18 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS® software enables unlicensed administrators to view clear-text data captured using the  packet capture feature https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-0/pan-os-admin/monitoring/take-packet-captures/take-a-custom-packet-capture  in decrypted HTTP/2 data streams traversing network interfaces on the firewall. HTTP/1.1 data streams are not impacted.

In normal conditions, decrypted packet captures are available to firewall administrators after they obtain and install a free Decryption Port Mirror license. The license requirement ensures that this feature can only be used after approved personnel purposefully activate the license. For more information, review how to  configure decryption port mirroring https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/decryption/administration/monitoring-decryption/configure-decryption-port-mirroring .

The administrator must obtain network access to the management interface (web, SSH, console, or telnet) and successfully authenticate to exploit this issue. Risk of this issue can be greatly reduced by restricting access to the management interface to only trusted administrators and from only internal IP addresses according to our recommended  critical deployment guidelines https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431 .

Customer firewall administrators do not have access to the packet capture feature in Cloud NGFW. This feature is available only to authorized Palo Alto Networks personnel permitted to perform troubleshooting.

Prisma® Access is not impacted by this vulnerability.

      <title>CVE-2025-30656 - Juniper Junos OS Packet Forwarding Engine Denial-of-Service Memory Corruption</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30656
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 9, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An Improper Handling of Additional Special Element vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MS-MPC, MS-MIC and SPC3, and SRX Series, allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

If the SIP ALG processes specifically formatted SIP invites, a memory corruption will occur which will lead to a crash of the FPC processing these packets. Although the system will automatically recover with the restart of the FPC, subsequent SIP invites will cause the crash again and lead to a sustained DoS.




This issue affects Junos OS on MX Series and SRX Series: 

  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9,
  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S10,
  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6,
  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S5,

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30657
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 9, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output vulnerability in the Sampling Route Record Daemon (SRRD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

When a device configured for flow-monitoring receives a specific BGP update message, it is correctly processed internally by the routing protocol daemon (rpd), but when it's sent to SRRD it's encoded incorrectly which leads to a crash and momentary interruption of jflow processing until it automatically restarts. This issue does not affect traffic forwarding itself.
This issue affects Junos OS: 



  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9,
  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S10,

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30658
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 9, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Anti-Virus processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series 

allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

On all SRX platforms with Anti-Virus enabled, if a server sends specific content in the HTTP body of a response to a client request, these packets are queued by Anti-Virus processing in Juniper Buffers (jbufs) which are never released. When these jbufs are exhausted, the device stops forwarding all transit traffic.

A jbuf memory leak can be noticed from the following logs:

(<node>.)<fpc> Warning: jbuf pool id <#> utilization level (<current level>%) is above <threshold>%!

To recover from this issue, the affected device needs to be manually rebooted to free the leaked jbufs.




This issue affects Junos OS on SRX Series: 

  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9,
  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S10,
  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6,

      <title>CVE-2025-30644 - Juniper Networks Junos OS Flexible PIC Concentrator Remote Code Execution and Denial of Service Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30644
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 9, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 8 hours, 3 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the flexible PIC concentrator (FPC) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on EX2300, EX3400, EX4100, EX4300, EX4300MP, EX4400, EX4600, EX4650-48Y, and QFX5k Series allows an attacker to send a specific DHCP packet to the device, leading to an FPC crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Under a rare timing scenario outside the attacker's control, memory corruption may be observed when DHCP Option 82 is enabled, leading to an FPC crash and affecting packet forwarding. Due to the nature of the heap-based overflow, exploitation of this vulnerability could also lead to remote code execution within the FPC, resulting in complete control of the vulnerable component.
This issue affects Junos OS on EX2300, EX3400, EX4100, EX4300, EX4300MP, EX4400, EX4600, EX4650-48Y, and QFX5k Series:

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32033
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 7, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Apollo Router Core is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. Prior to 1.61.2 and 2.1.1, the operation limits plugin uses unsigned 32-bit integers to track limit counters (e.g. for a query's height). If a counter exceeded the maximum value for this data type (4,294,967,295), it wrapped around to 0, unintentionally allowing queries to bypass configured thresholds. This could occur for large queries if the payload limit were sufficiently increased, but could also occur for small queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments. This has been remediated in apollo-router versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32034
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 7, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Apollo Router Core is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. Prior to 1.61.2 and 2.1.1, a vulnerability in Apollo Router allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to query plan, specifically during named fragment expansion. Named fragments were being expanded once per fragment spread during query planning, leading to exponential resource usage when deeply nested and reused fragments were involved. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service. This has been remediated in apollo-router versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 4, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 42 minutes ago

      <title>CVE-2025-2075 - WordPress Uncanny Automator Privilege Escalation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-2075
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 4, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 42 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Uncanny Automator – Easy Automation, Integration, Webhooks & Workflow Builder Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 6.3.0.2. This is due to add_role() and user_role() functions missing proper capability checks performed through the validate_rest_call() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to set the role of arbitrary users to administrator granting full access to the site, though privilege escalation requires an active account on the site so this is considered an authenticated privilege escalation.

      <title>CVE-2025-30370 - Jupyterlab-Git Command Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30370
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 3, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>jupyterlab-git is a JupyterLab extension for version control using Git. On many platforms, a third party can create a Git repository under a name that includes a shell command substitution string in the syntax $(<command>). These directory names are allowed in macOS and a majority of Linux distributions. If a user starts jupyter-lab in a parent directory of this inappropriately-named Git repository, opens it, and clicks "Git > Open Git Repository in Terminal" from the menu bar, then the injected command <command> is run in the user's shell without the user's permission. This issue is occurring because when that menu entry is clicked, jupyterlab-git opens the terminal and runs cd <git-repo-path> through the shell to set the current directory. Doing so runs any command substitution strings present in the directory name, which leads to the command injection issue described here. A previous patch provided an incomplete fix. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.51.1.

<strong>Description : </strong>The LuckyWP Table of Contents plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.10. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'ajaxEdit' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

      <title>CVE-2025-21996 - Radeon Linux Kernel Uninitialized Variable Use</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21996
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 3, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/radeon: fix uninitialized size issue in radeon_vce_cs_parse()

On the off chance that command stream passed from userspace via
ioctl() call to radeon_vce_cs_parse() is weirdly crafted and
first command to execute is to encode (case 0x03000001), the function
in question will attempt to call radeon_vce_cs_reloc() with size
argument that has not been properly initialized. Specifically, 'size'
will point to 'tmp' variable before the latter had a chance to be
assigned any value.

Play it safe and init 'tmp' with 0, thus ensuring that
radeon_vce_cs_reloc() will catch an early error in cases like these.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static
analysis tool SVACE.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21999
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 3, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

proc: fix UAF in proc_get_inode()

Fix race between rmmod and /proc/XXX's inode instantiation.

The bug is that pde->proc_ops don't belong to /proc, it belongs to a
module, therefore dereferencing it after /proc entry has been registered
is a bug unless use_pde/unuse_pde() pair has been used.

use_pde/unuse_pde can be avoided (2 atomic ops!) because pde->proc_ops
never changes so information necessary for inode instantiation can be
saved _before_ proc_register() in PDE itself and used later, avoiding
pde->proc_ops->...  dereference.

      rmmod                         lookup
sys_delete_module
                         proc_lookup_de
			   pde_get(de);
			   proc_get_inode(dir->i_sb, de);
  mod->exit()
    proc_remove

	                         if (de->proc_ops->proc_read_iter)
                           --> As module is already freed, will trigger UAF

      <title>CVE-2025-22000 - Linux Kernel Memory Leak in Huge Memory Folios</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-22000
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 3, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/huge_memory: drop beyond-EOF folios with the right number of refs

When an after-split folio is large and needs to be dropped due to EOF,
folio_put_refs(folio, folio_nr_pages(folio)) should be used to drop all
page cache refs.  Otherwise, the folio will not be freed, causing memory
leak.

This leak would happen on a filesystem with blocksize > page_size and a
truncate is performed, where the blocksize makes folios split to >0 order
ones, causing truncated folios not being freed.

      <title>CVE-2025-22003 - Linux Kernel CAN Ucan Out-of-Bound Read Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-22003
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 3, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: ucan: fix out of bound read in strscpy() source

Commit 7fdaf8966aae ("can: ucan: use strscpy() to instead of strncpy()")
unintentionally introduced a one byte out of bound read on strscpy()'s
source argument (which is kind of ironic knowing that strscpy() is meant
to be a more secure alternative :)).

Let's consider below buffers:

  dest[len + 1]; /* will be NUL terminated */
  src[len]; /* may not be NUL terminated */

When doing:

  strncpy(dest, src, len);
  dest[len] = '\0';

strncpy() will read up to len bytes from src.

On the other hand:

  strscpy(dest, src, len + 1);

will read up to len + 1 bytes from src, that is to say, an out of bound
read of one byte will occur on src if it is not NUL terminated. Note
that the src[len] byte is never copied, but strscpy() still needs to
read it to check whether a truncation occurred or not.

This exact pattern happened in ucan.

The root cause is that the source is not NUL terminated. Instead of
doing a copy in a local buffer, directly NUL terminate it as soon as
usb_control_msg() returns. With this, the local firmware_str[] variable
can be removed.

On top of this do a couple refactors:

  - ucan_ctl_payload->raw is only used for the firmware string, so
    rename it to ucan_ctl_payload->fw_str and change its type from u8 to
    char.

  - ucan_device_request_in() is only used to retrieve the firmware
    string, so rename it to ucan_get_fw_str() and refactor it to make it
    directly handle all the string termination logic.

      <title>CVE-2025-22005 - Linux Kernel IPv6 Memory Leak Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-22005
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 3, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: Fix memleak of nhc_pcpu_rth_output in fib_check_nh_v6_gw().

fib_check_nh_v6_gw() expects that fib6_nh_init() cleans up everything
when it fails.

Commit 7dd73168e273 ("ipv6: Always allocate pcpu memory in a fib6_nh")
moved fib_nh_common_init() before alloc_percpu_gfp() within fib6_nh_init()
but forgot to add cleanup for fib6_nh->nh_common.nhc_pcpu_rth_output in
case it fails to allocate fib6_nh->rt6i_pcpu, resulting in memleak.

Let's call fib_nh_common_release() and clear nhc_pcpu_rth_output in the
error path.

Note that we can remove the fib6_nh_release() call in nh_create_ipv6()
later in net-next.git.

      <title>CVE-2025-22006 - Cisco Ethernet Linux Kernel NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-22006
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 3, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: Fix NAPI registration sequence

Registering the interrupts for TX or RX DMA Channels prior to registering
their respective NAPI callbacks can result in a NULL pointer dereference.
This is seen in practice as a random occurrence since it depends on the
randomness associated with the generation of traffic by Linux and the
reception of traffic from the wire.

Il vise à garantir que les produits des technologies de l’information et de la communication tels que les composants technologiques, le matériel et les logiciels, répondent à des normes de sécurité strictes. Le but : renforcer la cybersécurité et garantir la cohérence des approches dans l’ensemble de l’Union européenne.</p>
<p>L’ANSSI est l’autorité nationale de certification de cybersécurité, à double titre. D’une part, l<strong>e Centre de certification national de l’ANSSI (CCN) est en charge de délivrer les certifications pour le niveau élevé du schéma EUCC</strong>. Au cours de l’année écoulée, les équipes de l’ANSSI et leurs partenaires se sont mis en ordre de bataille afin de pouvoir délivrer, sous les meilleurs délais, des certificats EUCC. D’autre part, <strong>la Mission Contrôles et Supervision de l’ANSSI instruit la procédure d’autorisation des organismes d’évaluation de la conformité</strong> nécessaire au préalable.</p>
<p>Le Centre de certification national a reçu l’accréditation du Cofrac le 28 mars dernier, puis l’autorisation de la Mission Contrôles et Supervision pour certifier les produits appartenant aux 3 domaines « Cartes à puce et dispositifs similaires », « Dispositifs matériels avec boîtiers de sécurité » et « Produits réseaux ou logiciels génériques »<sup>1</sup> . En parallèle, le centre d’évaluation de la sécurité (CESTI) Serma Safety & Security, avec lequel travaille CCN, a lui-même été accrédité et autorisé. <a href="https://certification.enisa.europa.eu/certificates_en"><strong>Deux certificats EUCC ont ainsi pu être émis par l’ANSSI</strong></a> le 31 mars 2025, suite à des évaluations conduites par Serma Safety & Security, pour les solutions des entreprises STMicroelectronics et Thales DIS France. Les certificats en question sont les premiers certificats EUCC à être publiés en Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Certificats EUCC : quelles modalités ?</strong></p>
<p>Depuis le 27 février 2025, tous les enregistrements de produits à évaluer selon les critères communs se font par une certification EUCC (hors cas spécifiques de défense et sécurité nationale).</p>
<p>Les certificats EUCC sont <strong>valables cinq ans</strong>, avec des conditions de maintien et de surveillance clairement définies dans le schéma. Ces dernières permettent de garantir la pérennité de la sécurité des solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Le formulaire de dossier d’évaluation est disponible </strong><a href="https://cyber.gouv.fr/documents-applicables-la-certification-criteres-communs-cc"><strong>ici</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Par ailleurs, les certificats EUCC ne remplacent pas le schéma <a href="https://cyber.gouv.fr/presentation-de-la-certification-de-securite-de-premier-niveau-cspn">CSPN</a> (certification de premier niveau) de l’ANSSI.</p>

      <title>CVE-2025-3153 - Concrete CMS Address Attribute Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3153
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 3, 2025, 2:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Concrete CMS version 9 below 9.4.0RC2 and versions below 8.5.20 are vulnerable to CSRF and XSS in the Concrete CMS Address attribute because addresses are not properly sanitized in the output when a country is not specified.  Attackers are limited to individuals whom a site administrator has granted the ability to fill in an address attribute. It is possible for the attacker to glean limited information from the site but amount and type is restricted by mitigating controls and the level of access of the attacker. Limited data modification is possible. The dashboard page itself could be rendered unavailable. 
The fix only sanitizes new data uploaded post update to Concrete CMS 9.4.0RC2. Existing database entries added before the update will still be “live” if there were successful exploits added under previous versions; a database search is recommended. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability CVSS v.4.0 score of 5.1  with vector CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L Thanks Myq Larson for reporting.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-27608
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Arduino IDE 2.x is an IDE based on the Theia IDE framework and built with Electron. A Self Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified within the Arduino-IDE prior to version v2.3.5. The vulnerability occurs in the Additional Board Manager URLs field, which can be found in the Preferences -> Settings section of the Arduino IDE interface. In the vulnerable versions, any values entered in this field are directly displayed to the user through a notification tooltip object, without a proper output encoding routine, due to the underlying ElectronJS engine interpretation. This vulnerability exposes the input parameter to Self-XSS attacks, which may lead to security risks depending on where the malicious payload is injected. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.5.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. To mitigate CVE-2025-29927, Next.js validated the x-middleware-subrequest-id which persisted across multiple incoming requests. However, this subrequest ID is sent to all requests, even if the destination is not the same host as the Next.js application. Initiating a fetch request to a third-party within Middleware will send the x-middleware-subrequest-id to that third party. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.6, 13.5.10, 14.2.26, and 15.2.4.

      <title>CVE-2025-31477 - Tauri Shell Plugin Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-31477
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Tauri shell plugin allows access to the system shell. Prior to 2.2.1, the Tauri shell plugin exposes functionality to execute code and open programs on the system. The open endpoint of this plugin is designed to allow open functionality with the system opener (e.g. xdg-open on Linux). This was meant to be restricted to a reasonable number of protocols like https or mailto by default. This default restriction was not functional due to improper validation of the allowed protocols, allowing for potentially dangerous protocols like file://, smb://, or nfs:// and others to be opened by the system registered protocol handler. By passing untrusted user input to the open endpoint these potentially dangerous protocols can be abused to gain remote code execution on the system. This either requires direct exposure of the endpoint to application users or code execution in the frontend of a Tauri application. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-31479 - GitHub Get-Workflow-Version-Action Token Truncation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-31479
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>canonical/get-workflow-version-action is a GitHub composite action to get commit SHA that GitHub Actions reusable workflow was called with. Prior to 1.0.1, if the get-workflow-version-action step fails, the exception output may include the GITHUB_TOKEN. If the full token is included in the exception output, GitHub will automatically redact the secret from the GitHub Actions logs. However, the token may be truncated—causing part of the GITHUB_TOKEN to be displayed in plaintext in the GitHub Actions logs. Anyone with read access to the GitHub repository can view GitHub Actions logs. For public repositories, anyone can view the GitHub Actions logs. The opportunity to exploit this vulnerability is limited—the GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically revoked when the job completes. However, there is an opportunity for an attack in the time between the GITHUB_TOKEN being displayed in the logs and the completion of the job. Users using the github-token input are impacted. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.1.

smb_acl has ->size field to calculate actual number of aces in request buffer
size. Use this to check invalid num_aces.

      <title>CVE-2025-21991 - AMD CPU Microcode Out-of-Bounds Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21991
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 3 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/microcode/AMD: Fix out-of-bounds on systems with CPU-less NUMA nodes

Currently, load_microcode_amd() iterates over all NUMA nodes, retrieves their
CPU masks and unconditionally accesses per-CPU data for the first CPU of each
mask.

According to Documentation/admin-guide/mm/numaperf.rst:

  "Some memory may share the same node as a CPU, and others are provided as
  memory only nodes."

Therefore, some node CPU masks may be empty and wouldn't have a "first CPU".

On a machine with far memory (and therefore CPU-less NUMA nodes):
- cpumask_of_node(nid) is 0
- cpumask_first(0) is CONFIG_NR_CPUS
- cpu_data(CONFIG_NR_CPUS) accesses the cpu_info per-CPU array at an
  index that is 1 out of bounds

This does not have any security implications since flashing microcode is
a privileged operation but I believe this has reliability implications by
potentially corrupting memory while flashing a microcode update.

When booting with CONFIG_UBSAN_BOUNDS=y on an AMD machine that flashes
a microcode update. I get the following splat:

  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/microcode/amd.c:X:Y
  index 512 is out of range for type 'unsigned long[512]'
  [...]
  Call Trace:
   dump_stack
   __ubsan_handle_out_of_bounds
   load_microcode_amd
   request_microcode_amd
   reload_store
   kernfs_fop_write_iter
   vfs_write
   ksys_write
   do_syscall_64
   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe

Change the loop to go over only NUMA nodes which have CPUs before determining
whether the first CPU on the respective node needs microcode update.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: ignore non-functional sensor in HP 5MP Camera

The HP 5MP Camera (USB ID 0408:5473) reports a HID sensor interface that
is not actually implemented. Attempting to access this non-functional
sensor via iio_info causes system hangs as runtime PM tries to wake up
an unresponsive sensor.

  [453] hid-sensor-hub 0003:0408:5473.0003: Report latency attributes: ffffffff:ffffffff
  [453] hid-sensor-hub 0003:0408:5473.0003: common attributes: 5:1, 2:1, 3:1 ffffffff:ffffffff

Add this device to the HID ignore list since the sensor interface is
non-functional by design and should not be exposed to userspace.

      <title>CVE-2025-21993 - IBM iSCSI IPv6 Subnet Mask Out-of-Bounds Vulnerability</title>

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21993
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 3 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iscsi_ibft: Fix UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warning in ibft_attr_show_nic()

When performing an iSCSI boot using IPv6, iscsistart still reads the
/sys/firmware/ibft/ethernetX/subnet-mask entry. Since the IPv6 prefix
length is 64, this causes the shift exponent to become negative,
triggering a UBSAN warning. As the concept of a subnet mask does not
apply to IPv6, the value is set to ~0 to suppress the warning message.

<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A flaw was found in the Tempo Operator. When the Jaeger UI Monitor Tab functionality is enabled in a Tempo instance managed by the Tempo Operator, the Operator creates a ClusterRoleBinding for the Service Account of the Tempo instance to grant the cluster-monitoring-view ClusterRole.
This can be exploited if a user has 'create' permissions on TempoStack and 'get' permissions on Secret in a namespace (for example, a user has ClusterAdmin permissions for a specific namespace), as the user can read the token of the Tempo service account and therefore has access to see all cluster metrics.

      <title>CVE-2025-2786 - Tempo Operator Information Disclosure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-2786
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 3 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A flaw was found in Tempo Operator, where it creates a ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, and ClusterRoleBinding when a user deploys a TempoStack or TempoMonolithic instance. This flaw allows a user with full access to their namespace to extract the ServiceAccount token and use it to submit TokenReview and SubjectAccessReview requests, potentially revealing information about other users' permissions. While this does not allow privilege escalation or impersonation, it exposes information that could aid in gathering information for further attacks.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-39780
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 6 hours, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A YAML deserialization vulnerability was found in the Robot Operating System (ROS) 'dynparam', a command-line tool for getting, setting, and deleting parameters of a dynamically configurable node, affecting ROS distributions Noetic and earlier. The issue is caused by the use of the yaml.load() function in the 'set' and 'get' verbs, and allows for the creation of arbitrary Python objects. Through this flaw, a local or remote user can craft and execute arbitrary Python code. This issue has now been fixed for ROS Noetic via commit 3d93ac13603438323d7e9fa74e879e45c5fe2e8e.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-31135
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 38 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Go-Guerrilla SMTP Daemon is a lightweight SMTP server written in Go. Prior to 1.6.7, when ProxyOn is enabled, the PROXY command will be accepted multiple times, with later invocations overriding earlier ones. The proxy protocol only supports one initial PROXY header; anything after that is considered part of the exchange between client and server, so the client is free to send further PROXY commands with whatever data it pleases. go-guerrilla will treat these as coming from the reverse proxy, allowing a client to spoof its IP address. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.7.

      <title>CVE-2025-30356 - "CryptoLib Heap Buffer Overflow Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30356
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 37 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In 1.3.3 and earlier, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability persists in the Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity function due to an incomplete validation check on the fl (frame length) field. Although CVE-2025-29912 addressed an underflow issue involving fl, the patch fails to fully prevent unsafe calculations. As a result, an attacker can still craft malicious frames that cause a negative tf_payload_len, which is then interpreted as a large unsigned value, leading to a heap buffer overflow in a memcpy call.

      <title>CVE-2025-21970 - "mlx5 Bridge LAG State Check Crash"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21970
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Bridge, fix the crash caused by LAG state check

When removing LAG device from bridge, NETDEV_CHANGEUPPER event is
triggered. Driver finds the lower devices (PFs) to flush all the
offloaded entries. And mlx5_lag_is_shared_fdb is checked, it returns
false if one of PF is unloaded. In such case,
mlx5_esw_bridge_lag_rep_get() and its caller return NULL, instead of
the alive PF, and the flush is skipped.

Besides, the bridge fdb entry's lastuse is updated in mlx5 bridge
event handler. But this SWITCHDEV_FDB_ADD_TO_BRIDGE event can be
ignored in this case because the upper interface for bond is deleted,
and the entry will never be aged because lastuse is never updated.

To make things worse, as the entry is alive, mlx5 bridge workqueue
keeps sending that event, which is then handled by kernel bridge
notifier. It causes the following crash when accessing the passed bond
netdev which is already destroyed.

To fix this issue, remove such checks. LAG state is already checked in
commit 15f8f168952f ("net/mlx5: Bridge, verify LAG state when adding
bond to bridge"), driver still need to skip offload if LAG becomes
invalid state after initialization.

      <title>CVE-2025-21971 - "Linux Kernel net_sched TC_H_ROOT Class Creation Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21971
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: Prevent creation of classes with TC_H_ROOT

The function qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() uses TC_H_ROOT as a termination
condition when traversing up the qdisc tree to update parent backlog
counters. However, if a class is created with classid TC_H_ROOT, the
traversal terminates prematurely at this class instead of reaching the
actual root qdisc, causing parent statistics to be incorrectly maintained.
In case of DRR, this could lead to a crash as reported by Mingi Cho.

Prevent the creation of any Qdisc class with classid TC_H_ROOT
(0xFFFFFFFF) across all qdisc types, as suggested by Jamal.

      <title>CVE-2025-21972 - Linux Kernel MCTP Net Fragment Reassembly Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21972
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mctp: unshare packets when reassembling

Ensure that the frag_list used for reassembly isn't shared with other
packets. This avoids incorrect reassembly when packets are cloned, and
prevents a memory leak due to circular references between fragments and
their skb_shared_info.

The upcoming MCTP-over-USB driver uses skb_clone which can trigger the
problem - other MCTP drivers don't share SKBs.

A kunit test is added to reproduce the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-21973 - Here is the title:ASUS PRIME Z690-P D4 bnxt_en NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21973
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eth: bnxt: fix kernel panic in the bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx}

When qstats-get operation is executed, callbacks of netdev_stats_ops
are called. The bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx} collect per-queue stats
from sw_stats in the rings.
But {rx | tx | cp}_ring are allocated when the interface is up.
So, these rings are not allocated when the interface is down.

The qstats-get is allowed even if the interface is down. However,
the bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx}() accesses cp_ring and tx_ring
without null check.
So, it needs to avoid accessing rings if the interface is down.

Reproducer:
 ip link set $interface down
 ./cli.py --spec netdev.yaml --dump qstats-get
OR
 ip link set $interface down
 python ./stats.py

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21974
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eth: bnxt: return fail if interface is down in bnxt_queue_mem_alloc()

The bnxt_queue_mem_alloc() is called to allocate new queue memory when
a queue is restarted.
It internally accesses rx buffer descriptor corresponding to the index.
The rx buffer descriptor is allocated and set when the interface is up
and it's freed when the interface is down.
So, if queue is restarted if interface is down, kernel panic occurs.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: hyperv_fb: Allow graceful removal of framebuffer

When a Hyper-V framebuffer device is unbind, hyperv_fb driver tries to
release the framebuffer forcefully. If this framebuffer is in use it
produce the following WARN and hence this framebuffer is never released.

Fix this by moving the release of framebuffer and assosiated memory
to fb_ops.fb_destroy function, so that framebuffer framework handles
it gracefully.

While we fix this, also replace manual registrations/unregistration of
framebuffer with devm_register_framebuffer.

memory address.

The scenario occurs when the hyperv_fb driver in the original kernel
moves the framebuffer to a different MMIO address because of conflicts
with an already-running efifb or simplefb driver. The hyperv_fb driver
then informs Hyper-V of the change, which is allowed by the Hyper-V FB
VMBus device protocol. However, when the kexec command loads the kdump
kernel into crash memory via the kexec_file_load() system call, the
system call doesn't know the framebuffer has moved, and it sets up the
kdump screen_info using the original framebuffer address. The transition
to the kdump kernel does not go through the Hyper-V host, so Hyper-V
does not reset the framebuffer address like it would do on a reboot.
When efifb tries to run, it accesses a non-existent framebuffer
address, which traps to the Hyper-V host. After many such accesses,
the Hyper-V host thinks the guest is being malicious, and throttles
the guest to the point that it runs very slowly or appears to have hung.

When the kdump kernel is loaded into crash memory via the kexec_load()
system call, the problem does not occur. In this case, the kexec command
builds the screen_info table itself in user space from data returned
by the FBIOGET_FSCREENINFO ioctl against /dev/fb0, which gives it the
new framebuffer location.

This problem was originally reported in 2020 [1], resulting in commit
3cb73bc3fa2a ("hyperv_fb: Update screen_info after removing old
framebuffer"). This commit solved the problem by setting orig_video_isVGA
to 0, so the kdump kernel was unaware of the EFI framebuffer. The efifb
driver did not try to load, and no hang occurred. But in 2024, commit
c25a19afb81c ("fbdev/hyperv_fb: Do not clear global screen_info")
effectively reverted 3cb73bc3fa2a. Commit c25a19afb81c has no reference
to 3cb73bc3fa2a, so perhaps it was done without knowing the implications
that were reported with 3cb73bc3fa2a. In any case, as of commit
c25a19afb81c, the original problem came back again.

Interestingly, the hyperv_drm driver does not have this problem because
it never moves the framebuffer. The difference is that the hyperv_drm
driver removes any conflicting framebuffers *before* allocating an MMIO
address, while the hyperv_fb drivers removes conflicting framebuffers
*after* allocating an MMIO address. With the "after" ordering, hyperv_fb
may encounter a conflict and move the framebuffer to a different MMIO
address. But the conflict is essentially bogus because it is removed
a few lines of code later.

Rather than fix the problem with the approach from 2020 in commit
3cb73bc3fa2a, instead slightly reorder the steps in hyperv_fb so
conflicting framebuffers are removed before allocating an MMIO address.
Then the default framebuffer MMIO address should always be available, and
there's never any confusion about which framebuffer address the kdump
kernel should use -- it's always the original address provided by
the Hyper-V host. This approach is already used by the hyperv_drm
driver, and is consistent with the usage guidelines at the head of
the module with the function aperture_remove_conflicting_devices().

This approach also solves a related minor problem when kexec_load()
is used to load the kdump kernel. With current code, unbinding and
rebinding the hyperv_fb driver could result in the framebuffer moving
back to the default framebuffer address, because on the rebind there
are no conflicts. If such a move is done after the kdump kernel is
loaded with the new framebuffer address, at kdump time it could again
have the wrong address.

This problem and fix are described in terms of the kdump kernel, but
it can also occur

      <title>CVE-2025-21978 - Hyper-V DRM Address Space Leak</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21978
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/hyperv: Fix address space leak when Hyper-V DRM device is removed

When a Hyper-V DRM device is probed, the driver allocates MMIO space for
the vram, and maps it cacheable. If the device removed, or in the error
path for device probing, the MMIO space is released but no unmap is done.
Consequently the kernel address space for the mapping is leaked.

Fix this by adding iounmap() calls in the device removal path, and in the
error path during device probing.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21979
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: cancel wiphy_work before freeing wiphy

A wiphy_work can be queued from the moment the wiphy is allocated and
initialized (i.e. wiphy_new_nm). When a wiphy_work is queued, the
rdev::wiphy_work is getting queued.

If wiphy_free is called before the rdev::wiphy_work had a chance to run,
the wiphy memory will be freed, and then when it eventally gets to run
it'll use invalid memory.

Fix this by canceling the work before freeing the wiphy.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21980
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched: address a potential NULL pointer dereference in the GRED scheduler.

If kzalloc in gred_init returns a NULL pointer, the code follows the
error handling path, invoking gred_destroy. This, in turn, calls
gred_offload, where memset could receive a NULL pointer as input,
potentially leading to a kernel crash.

When table->opt is NULL in gred_init(), gred_change_table_def()
is not called yet, so it is not necessary to call ->ndo_setup_tc()
in gred_offload().

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21981
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix memory leak in aRFS after reset

Fix aRFS (accelerated Receive Flow Steering) structures memory leak by
adding a checker to verify if aRFS memory is already allocated while
configuring VSI. aRFS objects are allocated in two cases:
- as part of VSI initialization (at probe), and
- as part of reset handling

However, VSI reconfiguration executed during reset involves memory
allocation one more time, without prior releasing already allocated
resources. This led to the memory leak with the following signature:

To address this switch to use of independent WQ_MEM_RECLAIM
workqueue, so the rules are not violated from workqueue framework
point of view.

Apart of that, since kvfree_rcu() does reclaim memory it is worth
to go with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM type of wq because it is designed for
this purpose.

      <title>CVE-2025-21984 - Linux Kernel mm Swapcache Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21984
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: fix kernel BUG when userfaultfd_move encounters swapcache

userfaultfd_move() checks whether the PTE entry is present or a
swap entry.

- If the PTE entry is present, move_present_pte() handles folio
  migration by setting:

  src_folio->index = linear_page_index(dst_vma, dst_addr);

- If the PTE entry is a swap entry, move_swap_pte() simply copies
  the PTE to the new dst_addr.

This approach is incorrect because, even if the PTE is a swap entry,
it can still reference a folio that remains in the swap cache.

This creates a race window between steps 2 and 4.
 1. add_to_swap: The folio is added to the swapcache.
 2. try_to_unmap: PTEs are converted to swap entries.
 3. pageout: The folio is written back.
 4. Swapcache is cleared.
If userfaultfd_move() occurs in the window between steps 2 and 4,
after the swap PTE has been moved to the destination, accessing the
destination triggers do_swap_page(), which may locate the folio in
the swapcache. However, since the folio's index has not been updated
to match the destination VMA, do_swap_page() will detect a mismatch.

This can result in two critical issues depending on the system
configuration.

If KSM is disabled, both small and large folios can trigger a BUG
during the add_rmap operation due to:

 page_pgoff(folio, page) != linear_page_index(vma, address)

      <title>CVE-2025-21985 - AMD Display Out-of-Bounds Array Index Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21985
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix out-of-bound accesses

[WHAT & HOW]
hpo_stream_to_link_encoder_mapping has size MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS(=4),
but location can have size up to 6. As a result, it is necessary to
check location against MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS.

Similiarly, disp_cfg_stream_location can be used as an array index which
should be 0..5, so the ASSERT's conditions should be less without equal.

      <title>CVE-2025-21986 - Linux Kernel: Switchdev Notification Chain Locking Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21986
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: switchdev: Convert blocking notification chain to a raw one

A blocking notification chain uses a read-write semaphore to protect the
integrity of the chain. The semaphore is acquired for writing when
adding / removing notifiers to / from the chain and acquired for reading
when traversing the chain and informing notifiers about an event.

In case of the blocking switchdev notification chain, recursive
notifications are possible which leads to the semaphore being acquired
twice for reading and to lockdep warnings being generated [1].

Specifically, this can happen when the bridge driver processes a
SWITCHDEV_BRPORT_UNOFFLOADED event which causes it to emit notifications
about deferred events when calling switchdev_deferred_process().

Fix this by converting the notification chain to a raw notification
chain in a similar fashion to the netdev notification chain. Protect
the chain using the RTNL mutex by acquiring it when modifying the chain.
Events are always informed under the RTNL mutex, but add an assertion in
call_switchdev_blocking_notifiers() to make sure this is not violated in
the future.

Maintain the "blocking" prefix as events are always emitted from process
context and listeners are allowed to block.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30177
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 34 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>Bypass/Injection vulnerability in Apache Camel in Camel-Undertow component under particular conditions.

This issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 before 4.10.3, from 4.8.0 before 4.8.6.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.3 for 4.10.x LTS and 4.8.6 for 4.8.x LTS.

<p>L’activité de gestion de crise est nécessaire dans le cas de situations graves ou complexes, notamment par l’ampleur et les impacts de l’incident vis-à-vis des activités métiers du bénéficiaire et sur besoin capacitaire ou d’expertise relative à la gestion de crise. Elle peut aussi être essentielle si le bénéficiaire n’a pas effectué de préparation à la gestion de crise.</p>
<p><u>Ainsi, elle vise à</u> :</p>
<ul><li>apporter une assistance en situation de crise afin de limiter les impacts de l’incident.</li>
<li>limiter les impacts d’une crise cyber en apportant une capacité de réponse et de soutien adéquate afin de préserver les intérêts du bénéficiaire ou du commanditaire (réputation, continuité des activités, rétablissement des capacités opérationnelles, etc.).</li>
</ul><p><u>Sur proposition de cette version, les PRIS de gestion de crise seront capables notamment </u>:</p>
<ul><li>de contribuer à la mise en place d’un dispositif de gestion de crise en situation d’urgence ,</li>
<li>d’établir un plan d’action de gestion de crise, et d’assurer une cohérence d’ensemble de gestion de crise,</li>
<li>d’apporter un premier niveau de conseil à la communication de crise, et connaissances des enjeux cyber et juridiques.</li>
</ul><p><em><u>NB</u></em><em> : les PRIS ne se substitueront pas aux différents organes du bénéficiaire (juridique, communication, etc.), ni à leurs responsabilités.</em></p>
<p>Cette nouvelle activité est mise en ligne aujourd’hui dans le cadre d’un appel public à commentaires. Les observations, les commentaires et les propositions peuvent être transmis jusqu’au <strong>30 mai 2025</strong>, de préférence par courriel, à l’adresse <a href="mailto:commentaires-passipdispris@ssi.gouv.fr">commentaires-passipdispris@ssi.gouv.fr</a> et à l’aide de la fiche de lecture ci-dessous.</p>
<p>La possibilité de faciliter les évaluations des prestataires candidats à la fois à la qualification PACS sur l’activité de préparation à la gestion de crise et à la qualification PRIS sur l’activité de gestion de crise sera étudiée une fois les exigences relatives à la gestion de crise dans le référentiel PRIS finalisées.</p>
<p>Pour faciliter la relecture, l’ANSSI fournit le référentiel avec marques de révision.</p>
<p>L’ANSSI remercie par avance tous ceux qui répondront à cet appel à commentaires.</p>

<p><strong>Courant 2024, l’ANSSI a sous-traité à la société Quarkslab le développement de « fuzzysully », un <em>fuzzer</em> pour le protocole OPC UA</strong>. <strong>L’ANSSI publie ce jour cet outil <a href="https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/fuzzysully">sur le dépôt Github de l’Agence</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Cette publication s’inscrit dans <a href="https://cyber.gouv.fr/open-source-lanssi">la démarche générale de l’ANSSI</a> visant à partager avec la communauté cyber les codes qu’elle produit et à accroître le niveau de sécurité des logiciels open source. L’Agence assurera le maintien en conditions de sécurité (MCS) de <strong>fuzzysully</strong> mais ne prévoit pas de le faire évoluer.</p>
<p><strong>L’ANSSI invite l’écosystème cyber à s’approprier cet outil de manière à évaluer la robustesse de différentes implémentations du protocole OPC UA et ainsi à participer à l’amélioration de la sécurité des SI industriels.</strong> Pour toutes remarques ou questions : <u>industries [at] ssi.gouv.fr</u>.</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-chapo field--type-string-long field--label-hidden field__item">Le panorama de la cybermenace 2024 dresse le bilan d’une année marquée par une pression désormais constante pesant tant sur l’écosystème national que sur les systèmes d’information les plus critiques. Pour faire face, l’ensemble des acteurs cyber français sont enjoints à maintenir leur mobilisation et leur vigilance de tous les instants.</div>
      
      <div class="field field--name-field-corps field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items">

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-texte-riche field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Au cours de l’année 2024, l’ANSSI a traité, avec différents niveaux de mobilisation, 4 386 événements de sécurité<sup>1</sup>, soit une augmentation de 15 % par rapport à l’année précédente. Ainsi, 3 004 signalements<sup>2</sup> et 1 361 incidents<sup>3</sup> ont été portés à la connaissance de l’Agence.</p>
<h3>Trois principales menaces : cybercriminels, attaquants réputés liés à la Russie et attaquants réputés liées à la Chine</h3>
<p>La menace portée par l’écosystème cybercriminel - principalement caractérisée par des attaques visant l’extorsion de rançons, <em>via</em> des fuites de données et des attaques par rançongiciel – s’est imposée comme un risque global et quotidien pour toutes les organisations françaises. Parmi les victimes de rançongiciels connues de l’ANSSI, les PME/TPE/ETI (37 %), les collectivités territoriales (17 %), ainsi que les établissements d’enseignement supérieur (12 %) et les entreprises stratégiques (12 %) ont été plus particulièrement touchés, avec des conséquences souvent très graves sur leur fonctionnement, leur réputation et leur continuité d’activité.</p>
<p>Une hausse des attaques à but de déstabilisation a également été observée, généralement menées par des groupes dits « hacktivistes » cherchant à attirer l’attention en mettant en œuvre des attaques de faible technicité mais à forte visibilité. Par exemple, les attaques par déni de service (DDoS) contre des cibles françaises ont doublé par rapport à 2023, avec une recrudescence pendant la période des Jeux. Malgré les conséquences limitées de ces dernières, le sabotage de petites installations industrielles a aussi été relevé. Ces attaques représentent une évolution vers une logique de sabotage, pour laquelle une vigilance s’impose.</p>
<p>À l’instar des années précédentes, ce sont les attaques à finalité d’espionnage qui ont le plus mobilisé les équipes opérationnelles de l’ANSSI. Les attaquants réputés liés aux intérêts stratégiques russes ont poursuivi leurs attaques guidées principalement par la recherche d’informations pouvant soutenir leurs efforts militaires ou diplomatiques. De son côté, l’activité associée aux modes opératoires réputés chinois a été particulièrement dense et répandue à des fins de captation de renseignements d’ordres stratégique et économique. Par ailleurs, le ciblage d’opérateurs de télécommunications s’est avéré intense et plusieurs incidents d’importance ont été traités par l’Agence.</p>
<h3>Mobilisation et vigilance des acteurs français : l'héritage indispensable des jeux</h3>
<p>L’année 2024 a été marquée par l’organisation des JOP, dont l’exposition médiatique et la surface d’attaque ont constitué des opportunités majeures pour les acteurs malveillants. Cependant, aucune de ces attaques n’a porté atteinte au déroulement de l’événement grâce à la bonne préparation et la grande mobilisation des équipes de l’ANSSI et de l’ensemble de l’écosystème cyber français.</p>
<p>Outre des opportunités conjoncturelles comme les Jeux, les attaquants se saisissent de toutes les faiblesses techniques exposées par les systèmes d’information (SI). Face à ce niveau de sécurité insuffisant, l’Agence enjoint les organisations à durcir et maintenir en condition de sécurité leurs SI afin de réduire la surface d’attaque. En particulier, au regard du nombre et de l’impact des vulnérabilités affectant les équipements de sécurité situés en bordure de SI – qui ont représenté plus de la moitié des opérations de cyberdéfense de l’ANSSI - l’Agence rappelle la nécessité urgente d’appliquer les correctifs de sécurité et ce le plus rapidement possible afin de se protéger d’exploitations opportunistes.</p>
<h3>L'ANSSI au c<strong>œ</strong>ur d'un collectif, pour une nation cyber-résiliente</h3>
<p>L’année écoulée a conforté l’Agence dans sa volonté de consolider un écosystème relai efficace. En effet, le renforcement des acteurs qui le composent, tels que les centres de réponse à incidents cyber (CSIRT) territoriaux, sectoriels ou ministériels, a déjà permis à l’ANSSI de concentrer son implication sur des attaques ayant des impacts plus critiques.</p>
<p>Face à l'ensemble de ces menaces, la France n'est pas désarmée : les travaux sur le volet cyber du projet de loi Résilience, visant à transporter la directive NIS 2 en France, constituent un pan essentiel de sa réponse. La démarche de co-construction choisie pour cette transposition a permis d'adapter au mieux le texte aux réalités et enjeux des entités afin d'en favoriser son appropriation et sa mise en œuvre</p>
<p>Enfin, il apparaît indispensable pour l’ANSSI de maintenir la pression sur l’écosystème cybercriminel en poursuivant sa coopération avec les autres services de l'État et les partenaires internationaux. Cette coopération a notamment permis de réaliser des opérations de démantèlement sur l’année écoulée.</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-texte-riche field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>L’intelligence artificielle, le cloud ou bien encore le développement potentiel d’un ordinateur quantique capable de remettre en cause les propriétés fondamentales de la cryptographie asymétrique, ces technologies bouleversent notre monde et notre approche du cyberespace alors que la menace cyber affecte dorénavant tous les pans de notre économie et de notre société. Cette menace est par ailleurs accentuée par une situation internationale de plus en plus conflictuelle, qui a des répercussions toujours plus significatives dans le cyberespace.</p>
<p>Depuis plusieurs années, la France et l’Union européenne (UE) travaillent à la prise en compte de ces paramètres au travers notamment de réseaux de coopération et de différents textes règlementaires (directive sur la sécurité des réseaux et des systèmes d’information (NIS 2), règlement sur la résilience cyber (CRA), etc.), qui participent tous à un objectif d’élévation générale de la cybersécurité de l’UE et de ses Etats membres.</p>
<p>La réussite des Jeux olympiques et paralympiques de Paris 2024 (JOP) a été l’aboutissement d’un travail intense durant deux ans des agents de l’ANSSI et de « l’équipe de France » de la cybersécurité dans son ensemble. Au-delà des enseignements qui ont déjà été tirés sur le travail de préparation, d’entrainement et d’articulation avec l’écosystème, y compris international, cette réussite des JOP est venue consacrer un modèle français de la cybersécurité qui repose sur une séparation claire, au sein de l’État, entre les missions défensives et offensives, l’Agence étant chargée de coordonner le champ de la défense et de la protection des systèmes d’information.</p>
<p>Forte de ces constats, prenant acte des évolutions du paysage cyber et s’appuyant sur la compétence, l’ouverture et l’agilité qui constituent ses trois valeurs centrales, l’ANSSI a rédigé un nouveau plan stratégique cinq ans après le Manifeste, dernier document stratégique publié par l’Agence à l’occasion de ses 10 ans. Dans le cadre posé par la stratégie nationale de cybersécurité, ce plan a vocation à guider l’ANSSI au cours des prochaines années dans une logique de co-construction avec l’ensemble des parties prenantes et en permettant au collectif national des acteurs de la cybersécurité d’amplifier leurs actions et leur impact.</p>
<p>Il est construit autour de 4 axes :</p>
<ul><li>Amplifier et coordonner la réponse cyber face à la massification de la menace</li>
<li>Développer les expertises indispensables pour contrer les menaces cyber</li>
<li>Promouvoir une action cyber européenne et internationale efficace</li>
<li>Renforcer la prise en compte des enjeux sociétaux dans l’action de l’ANSSI</li>
</ul><p>Avec ce plan, l’ANSSI s’inscrit plus que jamais « au cœur d’un collectif, pour une nation cyber-résiliente ».</p>

Pour ce faire, l’ANSSI met à disposition son état de la menace sur le <em>cloud </em>et partage ses<em> </em>recommandations de sécurité pour y faire face.</p>
<h3>L’ environnement <em>cloud,</em> une cible grandissante des cyberattaques</h3>
<p>Les environnements<em> cloud </em>sont de plus en plus la cible d’attaquants cherchant à compromettre l’intégrité de ces systèmes. Cela s’explique notamment par l’intérêt pour les données traitées par les fournisseurs de service cloud, mais également parce qu’ils offrent une entrée potentielle vers les organisations qui utilisent ces services.</p>
<p>Le ciblage d’environnement cloud fait désormais partie intégrante du mode opératoire des attaquants qui ont développé des compétences bien spécifiques et poursuivent des finalités lucratives, d’espionnage, et ou de déstabilisation. Cette maîtrise grandissante de ces environnements cloud entraîne l’accroissement des tentatives de latéralisation depuis des environnements on-premise compromis vers le cloud et réciproquement.</p>
<p>Les vulnérabilités dans des équipements de bordure (tels que des VPN) sont notamment devenues des points d’entrée privilégiés pour les attaquants. Ils exploitent également les mauvaises configurations et les défauts de sécurisation (permissions excessives, applications obsolètes).</p>
<h3>L’utilisation du<em> cloud</em> pose de nouveaux défis en matière de sécurité informatique</h3>
<p>Une tendance grandissante identifiée par l’ANSSI dans son rapport est l’utilisation des services de <em>cloud</em> comme infrastructures d’attaques. Les acteurs malveillants utilisent désormais des services <em>cloud</em> à des fins malveillantes, dans le but de stocker, des codes malveillants ou des données volées sur des plateformes grand public. Il devient alors très complexe de détecter les activités malveillantes en les dissimulant au sein du trafic légitime des utilisateurs de ces plateformes.</p>
<p>Les enjeux de sécurité qui accompagnent l’utilisation du <em>cloud</em> imposent de s’interroger sur les responsabilités qui incombent aussi bien aux fournisseurs de services<em> cloud</em> qu’aux utilisateurs de ces plateformes. L’ANSSI fait le constat que de nombreux incidents de sécurité sont<s> </s>dus à une faiblesse dans le cloisonnement entre les systèmes d’information en partie liée à l’usage du <em>cloud</em> ou aux manquements dans la supervision des systèmes d’information.</p>

<p>Dans son état de la menace, l’ANSSI partage ses recommandations, aussi bien pour les fournisseurs de cloud que pour les clients, qui visent à mettre en place des mesures de sécurité claires et des bonnes pratiques.</p>
<p>L’hébergement de certaines données dans le cloud nécessitent de réaliser une analyse de risques afin de déterminer l’offre adaptée. Pour accompagner les entités publiques et privées, l’ANSSI met à disposition :</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://cyber.gouv.fr/recourir-des-solutions-cloud">ses recommandations sur l’hébergement des systèmes d’informations sensibles dans le cloud</a><u>.</u> Cette série de recommandations précisent, en fonction du type de SI, de la sensibilité des données et du niveau de la menace, les types d’offres cloud à privilégier.</li>
</ul><p>L’ANSSI recommande de privilégier des offres cloisonnées entre clients de type SecNumCloud pour des activités sensibles. <a href="https://cyber.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/document/secnumcloud-referentiel-exigences-v3.2.pdf">Le référentiel SecNumCloud</a> propose un ensemble de règles de sécurité à suivre garantissant un haut niveau d’exigence tant du point de vue technique, qu’opérationnel ou juridique.</p>
<p>Enfin, le recours au cloud impose la prise en compte de l’évolution des capacités de supervision afin de se prémunir contre les menaces abordées dans le document.</p>

<p>En tant qu’autorité nationale en matière de cyberdéfense et de cybersécurité, l’ANSSI a travaillé à l’identification et la bonne compréhension des risques cyber des systèmes d’intelligence artificielle (SIA), en collaboration avec ses partenaires nationaux et internationaux, également réunis à Paris à l’occasion du Sommet pour l’action sur l’IA.</p>
<p><strong>Des systèmes d’information qui posent de nouveaux défis à la cybersécurité</strong></p>
<p>Dans les travaux qu’elle a menés, l’ANSSI souligne en premier lieu que les systèmes intégrant une IA (SIA) demeurent fondamentalement des systèmes logiciels, soumis en tout état de cause aux mêmes vulnérabilités que des systèmes plus classiques, comme le détournement de comptes utilisateurs ou administrateurs ou l’exploitation de vulnérabilités dans les composants logiciels intégrés dans le système. Les scénarios de cyberattaque classiques restent ainsi aujourd’hui les plus crédibles contre de tels SIA. Le respect des bonnes pratiques de cybersécurité applicables à tout système d’information, est ainsi un enjeu primordial pour la mise en œuvre d’une IA de confiance.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em> </em></strong><em>« Le temps fort qu’a constitué le Sommet pour l’action sur l’IA a démontré la nécessité de mieux faire travailler ensemble les experts de l’IA et ceux de la cybersécurité afin d’objectiver les risques et opportunités, loin des marchands de peur et des marchands de rêves.», </em>précise Vincent Strubel, directeur général de l’ANSSI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>L’ANSSI s’implique dans le développement d’une IA de confiance qui bénéficie à tous</strong></p>
<p>Afin d’accompagner le développement d’une IA de confiance qui bénéficie à tous et pour tous les usages, quelle que soit leur criticité, l’ANSSI promeut une approche par les risques.</p>
<p>Pour guider notamment les dirigeants et les producteurs de solutions d’IA, plusieurs livrables ont été dévoilés à l’occasion du Sommet :</p>
<ul><li>Le document de référence <a href="https://cyber.gouv.fr/en/publications/building-trust-ai-through-cyber-risk-based-approach">« <em>Building trust in AI through a cyber risk approach</em> »</a> : co-signé par de 19 partenaires internationaux et 5 partenaires nationaux a été présenté le 7 février lors des journées scientifiques organisées par l’Institut Polytechnique de Paris. Il met en évidence les risques cyber auxquels sont exposés les systèmes d’IA et relaie les principales recommandations stratégiques afin de favoriser une meilleure prise en compte de la cybersécurité dans le développement et l’intégration de ces systèmes. Cette analyse de risque a été élaborée suite aux consultations de plusieurs entités publiques et privées matures sur le sujet de l’IA, afin de s’assurer de toujours conserver un ancrage des travaux dans le réel. <em><a href="https://cyber.gouv.fr/publications/developper-la-confiance-dans-lia-par-une-approche-par-les-risques-cyber">Un document également disponible en français</a>.</em></li>
<li>L’exercice de crise cyber, organisé par l’ANSSI le 11 février au Campus Cyber, a mobilisé près de 200 participants experts cyber et experts IA dans l’objectif de développer une meilleure compréhension mutuelle de leurs attentes. Alors que le scénario proposé comprenait une cyberattaque affectant un SIA et sa chaine d’approvisionnement (supply chain), les participants ont pu échanger des bonnes pratiques tout en étant sensibilisés aux risques cyber. Des axes d’amélioration en matière de gestion de crise cyber ont notamment été identifiés lors de l’exercice et un retour d’expérience sera prochainement organisé.</li>
<li>La rencontre des directeurs d’agences cyber partenaires s’est déroulée en parallèle du Sommet. L’ANSSI et ses partenaires internationaux ont pu contribuer activement aux débats en cours sur la sécurisation de l’IA. Tous sont pleinement engagés dans le traitement, à l’échelle internationale, de ces questions, tout en veillant à explorer les modalités d’articulation et de coopération internationale en la matière. </li>

            <div class="field field--name-field-chapo field--type-string-long field--label-hidden field__item">La compétition KpqC qui a débuté en 2022, visait à sélectionner des algorithmes de cryptographie post-quantique. Julien Devevey, cryptologue du Laboratoire de Cryptographie de l’ANSSI, a participé à la conception de l’algorithme HAETAE qui a remporté cette compétition le 16 janvier 2025.</div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-texte-riche field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>La compétition coréenne, qui a débuté en 2022, visait la sélection et de la standardisation d'algorithmes post-quantiques KpqC qui opposait 16 algorithmes candidats. La cryptographie post quantique est l’ensemble des algorithmes cryptographiques [à clé publique] conçus pour résister non seulement aux attaques des ordinateurs actuels mais également aux attaques d’ordinateurs quantiques de très grande capacité. Les algorithmes post-quantiques peuvent être implémentés sur les ordinateurs actuels.</p>
<p>Parmi les 8 candidats qui restaient en lice au terme d'une présélection réalisée en 2023, la compétition a abouti à une sélection finale de 4 algorithmes le 16 janvier 2025.</p>
<p>Parmi les deux schémas de signature post-quantique sélectionnés figure HAETAE, fruit d'une coopération entre des équipes françaises, coréennes et allemandes. HAETAE, dont Julien Devevey, cryptologue à l'ANSSI est l'un des concepteurs, est fondé, de même que le standard NIST ML-DSA, sur la difficulté conjecturée du problème de réseaux euclidiens Module-LWE et sur une variante dite avec rejets du paradigme de Fiat-Shamir. Mais il est plus compact que ML-DSA : à niveau de sécurité égal, son intégration dans certains protocoles de l'internet nécessite de ce fait moins de fragmentation.</p>
<p>Les trois autres algorithmes de la sélection finale de la compétition KpqC sont un autre schéma de signature, AIMer, et deux schémas de chiffrement et d'établissement de clé, NTRU+ et SMAUG-T.</p>
