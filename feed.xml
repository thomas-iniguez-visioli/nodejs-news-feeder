      <title>CVE-2025-50675 - GPMAW Unprivileged Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-50675
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 7, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 27 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>GPMAW 14, a bioinformatics software, has a critical vulnerability related to insecure file permissions in its installation directory. The directory is accessible with full read, write, and execute permissions for all users, allowing unprivileged users to manipulate files within the directory, including executable files like GPMAW3.exe, Fragment.exe, and the uninstaller GPsetup64_17028.exe. An attacker with user-level access can exploit this misconfiguration by replacing or modifying the uninstaller (GPsetup64_17028.exe) with a malicious version. While the application itself runs in the user's context, the uninstaller is typically executed with administrative privileges when an administrator attempts to uninstall the software. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker could gain administrative privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the admin, resulting in privilege escalation.

      <title>CVE-2025-7195 - Operator-SDK Insecure User Setup Permissions Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7195
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 7, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 27 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Early versions of Operator-SDK provided an insecure method to allow operator containers to run in environments that used a random UID. Operator-SDK before 0.15.2 provided a script, user_setup, which modifies the permissions of the /etc/passwd file to 664 during build time. Developers who used Operator-SDK before 0.15.2 to scaffold their operator may still be impacted by this if the insecure user_setup script is still being used to build new container images. In affected images, the /etc/passwd file was created during build time with group-writable permissions and a group ownership of root (gid=0). An attacker who can execute commands within an affected container, even as a non-root user, may be able to leverage their membership in the root group to modify the /etc/passwd file. This could allow the attacker to add a new user with any arbitrary UID, including UID 0, leading to full root privileges within the container.

<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 7, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 16 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Cloudflare quiche was discovered to be vulnerable to an infinite loop when sending packets containing RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames.

QUIC connections possess a set of connection identifiers (IDs); see  Section 5.1 of RFC 9000 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-5.1 . Once the QUIC handshake completes, a local endpoint is responsible for issuing and retiring Connection IDs that are used by the remote peer to populate the Destination Connection ID field in packets sent from remote to local. Each Connection ID has a sequence number to ensure synchronization between peers.

An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by first completing a handshake and then sending a specially-crafted set of frames that trigger a connection ID retirement in the victim. When the victim attempts to send a packet containing RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames,  Section 19.16 of RFC 9000 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-19.6  requires that the sequence number of the retired connection ID must not be the same as the sequence number of the connection ID used by the packet. In other words, a packet cannot contain a frame that retires itself. In scenarios such as path migration, it is possible for there to be multiple active paths with different active connection IDs that could be used to retire each other. The exploit triggered an unintentional behaviour of a quiche design feature that supports retirement across paths while maintaining full connection ID synchronization, leading to an infinite loop.This issue affects quiche: from 0.15.0 before 0.24.5.

      <title>CVE-2025-54799 - Lego ACME Library HTTP to HTTPS Enforcement Weakness</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54799
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 7, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 14 hours, 49 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Let's Encrypt client and ACME library written in Go (Lego). In versions 4.25.1 and below, the github.com/go-acme/lego/v4/acme/api package (thus the lego library and the lego cli as well) don't enforce HTTPS when talking to CAs as an ACME client. Unlike the http-01 challenge which solves an ACME challenge over unencrypted HTTP, the ACME protocol requires HTTPS when a client communicates with the CA to performs ACME functions. However, the library fails to enforce HTTPS both in the original discover URL (configured by the library user) and in the subsequent addresses returned by the CAs in the directory and order objects. If users input HTTP URLs or CAs misconfigure endpoints, protocol operations occur over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This compromises privacy by exposing request/response details like account and request identifiers to network attackers. This was fixed in version 4.25.2.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54882
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 7, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 14 hours, 49 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Himmelblau is an interoperability suite for Microsoft Azure Entra ID and Intune. In versions 0.8.0 through 0.9.21 and 1.0.0-beta through 1.1.0, Himmelblau stores the cloud TGT received during logon in the Kerberos credential cache. The created credential cache collection and received credentials are stored as world readable. This is fixed in versions 0.9.22 and 1.2.0. To work around this issue, remove all read access to Himmelblau caches for all users except for owners.

      <title>CVE-2025-54885 - Thinbus Javascript Secure Remote Password SRP6a Protocol Compliance Bug</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54885
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 7, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 14 hours, 49 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Thinbus Javascript Secure Remote Password is a browser SRP6a implementation for zero-knowledge password authentication. In versions 2.0.0 and below, a protocol compliance bug causes the client to generate a fixed 252 bits of entropy instead of the intended bit length of the safe prime (defaulted to 2048 bits). The client public value is being generated from a private value that is 4 bits below the specification. This reduces the protocol's designed security margin it is now practically exploitable. The servers full sized 2048 bit random number is used to create the shared session key and password proof. This is fixed in version 2.0.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-20215 - Cisco Webex Meetings Unauthenticated Meeting-Join Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-20215
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 6, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in the meeting-join functionality of Cisco Webex Meetings could have allowed an unauthenticated, network-proximate attacker to complete a meeting-join process in place of an intended targeted user, provided the requisite conditions were satisfied. Cisco has addressed this vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Meetings service, and no customer action is needed.

This vulnerability existed due to client certificate validation issues. Prior to this vulnerability being addressed, an attacker could have exploited this vulnerability by monitoring local wireless or adjacent networks for client-join requests and attempting to interrupt and complete the meeting-join flow as another user who was currently joining a meeting. To successfully exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would need the capability to position themselves in a local wireless or adjacent network, to monitor and intercept the targeted network traffic flows, and to satisfy timing requirements in order to interrupt the meeting-join flow and exploit the vulnerability. A successful exploit could have allowed the attacker to join the meeting as another user. However, the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 6, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE and Cisco ISE-PIC could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack against a user of the interface.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have at least a low-privileged account on the affected device.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 6, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability was found in Keycloak-services. Special characters used during e-mail registration may perform SMTP Injection and unexpectedly send short unwanted e-mails. The email is limited to 64 characters (limited local part of the email), so the attack is limited to very shorts emails (subject and little data, the example is 60 chars). This flaw's only direct consequence is an unsolicited email being sent from the Keycloak server. However, this action could be a precursor for more sophisticated attacks.

      <title>CVE-2025-50234 - MCCMS SSRF Flaw</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-50234
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 6, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>MCCMS v2.7.0 has an SSRF vulnerability located in the index() method of the sys\apps\controllers\api\Gf.php file, where the pic parameter is processed. The pic parameter is decrypted using the sys_auth($pic, 1) function, which utilizes a hard-coded key Mc_Encryption_Key (bD2voYwPpNuJ7B8), defined in the db.php file. The decrypted URL is passed to the geturl() method, which uses cURL to make a request to the URL without proper security checks. An attacker can craft a malicious encrypted pic parameter, which, when decrypted, points to internal addresses or local file paths (such as http://127.0.0.1 or file://). By using the file:// protocol, the attacker can access arbitrary files on the local file system (e.g., file:///etc/passwd, file:///C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts), allowing them to read sensitive configuration files, log files, and more, leading to information leakage or system exposure. The danger of this SSRF vulnerability includes accessing internal services and local file systems through protocols like http://, ftp://, and file://, which can result in sensitive data leakage, remote code execution, privilege escalation, or full system compromise, severely affecting the system's security and stability.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-5197
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 6, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically in the `convert_tf_weight_name_to_pt_weight_name()` function. This function, responsible for converting TensorFlow weight names to PyTorch format, uses a regex pattern `/[^/]*___([^/]*)/` that can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption through crafted input strings due to catastrophic backtracking. The vulnerability affects versions up to 4.51.3 and is fixed in version 4.53.0. This issue can lead to service disruption, resource exhaustion, and potential API service vulnerabilities, impacting model conversion processes between TensorFlow and PyTorch formats.

      <title>CVE-2025-7771 - "ThrottleStop.sys Kernel Memory Access Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7771
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 6, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ThrottleStop.sys, a legitimate driver, exposes two IOCTL interfaces that allow arbitrary read and write access to physical memory via the MmMapIoSpace function. This insecure implementation can be exploited by a malicious user-mode application to patch the running Windows kernel and invoke arbitrary kernel functions with ring-0 privileges. The vulnerability enables local attackers to execute arbitrary code in kernel context, resulting in privilege escalation and potential follow-on attacks, such as disabling security software or bypassing kernel-level protections. ThrottleStop.sys version 3.0.0.0 and possibly others are affected. Apply updates per vendor instructions.

<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 6, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In versions 4.2-milestone-3 through 16.4.7, 16.5.0-rc-1 through 16.10.5 and 17.0.0-rc-1 through 17.2.2, two templates contain reflected XSS vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the victim's session by getting the victim to visit an attacker-controlled URL. This permits the attacker to perform arbitrary actions using the permissions of the victim. This issue is fixed in versions 16.4.8, 16.10.6 and 17.3.0-rc-1. To workaround the issue, manually patch the WAR with the same changes as the original patch.

<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 6, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. XWiki Platform Legacy Old Core and XWiki Platform Old Core versions 9.8-rc-1 through 16.4.6, 16.5.0-rc-1 through 16.10.4, and 17.0.0-rc-1 through 17.1.0, any user with editing rights can create an XClass with a database list property that references a password property. When adding an object of that XClass, the content of that password property is displayed. In practice, with a standard rights setup, this means that any user with an account on the wiki can access password hashes of all users, and possibly other password properties (with hashed or plain storage) that are on pages that the user can view. This issue is fixed in versions 16.4.7, 16.10.5 and 17.2.0-rc-1.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54594
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 6, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>react-native-bottom-tabs is a library of Native Bottom Tabs for React Native. In versions 0.9.2 and below, the github/workflows/release-canary.yml GitHub Actions repository workflow improperly used the pull_request_target event trigger, which allowed for untrusted code from a forked pull request to be executed in a privileged context. An attacker could create a pull request containing a malicious preinstall script in the package.json file and then trigger the vulnerable workflow by posting a specific comment (!canary). This allowed for arbitrary code execution, leading to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN and NPM_TOKEN, and could have allowed an attacker to push malicious code to the repository or publish compromised packages to the NPM registry. There is a remediation commit which removes github/workflows/release-canary.yml, but a version with this fix has yet to be released.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54801
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 6, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Fiber is an Express inspired web framework written in Go. In versions 2.52.8 and below, when using Fiber's Ctx.BodyParser to parse form data containing a large numeric key that represents a slice index (e.g., test.18446744073704), the application crashes due to an out-of-bounds slice allocation in the underlying schema decoder. The root cause is that the decoder attempts to allocate a slice of length idx + 1 without validating whether the index is within a safe or reasonable range. If the idx is excessively large, this leads to an integer overflow or memory exhaustion, causing a panic or crash. This is fixed in version 2.52.9.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54879
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 6, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub Mastodon which facilitates LDAP configuration for authentication. In versions 3.1.5 through 4.2.24, 4.3.0 through 4.3.11 and 4.4.0 through 4.4.3, Mastodon's rate-limiting system has a critical configuration error where the email-based throttle for confirmation emails incorrectly checks the password reset path instead of the confirmation path, effectively disabling per-email limits for confirmation requests. This allows attackers to bypass rate limits by rotating IP addresses and send unlimited confirmation emails to any email address, as only a weak IP-based throttle (25 requests per 5 minutes) remains active. The vulnerability enables denial-of-service attacks that can overwhelm mail queues and facilitate user harassment through confirmation email spam. This is fixed in versions 4.2.24, 4.3.11 and 4.4.3.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54883
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 6, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Vision UI is a collection of enterprise-grade, dependency-free modules for modern web projects. In versions 1.4.0 and below, the getSecureRandomInt function in security-kit versions prior to 3.5.0 (packaged in Vision-ui <= 1.4.0) contains a critical cryptographic weakness. Due to a silent 32-bit integer overflow in its internal masking logic, the function fails to produce a uniform distribution of random numbers when the requested range between min and max is larger than 2³². The root cause is the use of a 32-bit bitwise left-shift operation (<<) to generate a bitmask for the rejection sampling algorithm. This causes the mask to be incorrect for any range requiring 32 or more bits of entropy. This issue is fixed in version 1.5.0.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54884
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 6, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Vision UI is a collection of enterprise-grade, dependency-free modules for modern web projects. In versions 1.4.0 and below, the generateSecureId and getSecureRandomInt functions in security-kit versions prior to 3.5.0 (packaged in Vision UI 1.4.0 and below) are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The generateSecureId(length) function directly used the length parameter to size a Uint8Array buffer, allowing attackers to exhaust server memory through repeated requests for large IDs since the previous 1024 limit was insufficient. The getSecureRandomInt(min, max) function calculated buffer size based on the range between min and max, where large ranges caused excessive memory allocation and CPU-intensive rejection-sampling loops that could hang the thread. This issue is fixed in version 1.5.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-53534 - RatPanel Remote Code Execution and Unauthorized Access Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53534
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 5, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>RatPanel is a server operation and maintenance management panel. In versions 2.3.19 through 2.5.5, when an attacker obtains the backend login path of RatPanel (including but not limited to weak default paths, brute-force cracking, etc.), they can execute system commands or take over hosts managed by the panel without logging in. In addition to this remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, the flawed code also leads to unauthorized access. RatPanel uses the CleanPath middleware provided by github.com/go-chi/chi package to clean URLs, but but the middleware does not process r.URL.Path, which can cause the paths to be misinterpreted. This is fixed in version 2.5.6.

      <title>CVE-2025-51541 - Shopware Stored XSS Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-51541
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 5, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Shopware 6 installation interface at /recovery/install/database-configuration/. The c_database_schema field fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it in the browser, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript. This vulnerability can be exploited via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack due to the absence of CSRF protections on the POST request. An unauthenticated remote attacker can craft a malicious web page that, when visited by a victim, stores the payload persistently in the installation configuration. As a result, the payload executes whenever any user subsequently accesses the vulnerable installation page, leading to persistent client-side code execution.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 5, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 33 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>FreeFloat FTP Server contains multiple critical design flaws that allow unauthenticated remote attackers to upload arbitrary files to sensitive system directories. The server accepts empty credentials, defaults user access to the root of the C:\ drive, and imposes no restrictions on file type or destination path. These conditions enable attackers to upload executable payloads and .mof files to locations such as system32 and wbem\mof, where Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) automatically processes and executes them. This results in remote code execution with SYSTEM-level privileges, without requiring user interaction.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2012-10031
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 5, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 33 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>BlazeVideo HDTV Player Pro v6.6.0.3 is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow due to improper handling of user-supplied input embedded in .plf playlist files. When parsing a crafted .plf file, the MediaPlayerCtrl.dll component invokes PathFindFileNameA() to extract a filename from a URL-like string. The returned value is then copied to a fixed-size stack buffer using an inline strcpy call without bounds checking. If the input exceeds the buffer size, this leads to a stack overflow and potential arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.

      <title>CVE-2012-10032 - Maxthon Cross Context Scripting Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2012-10032
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 5, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 33 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Maxthon3 versions prior to 3.3 are vulnerable to cross context scripting (XCS) via the about:history page. The browser’s trusted zone improperly handles injected script content, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a privileged context. This flaw enables modification of browser configuration and execution of arbitrary code through Maxthon’s exposed DOM APIs, including maxthon.program.Program.launch() and maxthon.io.writeDataURL(). Exploitation requires user interaction, typically by visiting a malicious webpage that triggers the injection.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2012-10033
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 5, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 33 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Narcissus is vulnerable to remote code execution via improper input handling in its image configuration workflow. Specifically, the backend.php script fails to sanitize the release parameter before passing it to the configure_image() function. This function invokes PHP’s passthru() with the unsanitized input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary system commands. Exploitation occurs via a crafted POST request, resulting in command execution under the web server’s context.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-51060
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 5, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 9 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An issue was discovered in CPUID cpuz.sys 1.0.5.4. An attacker can use DeviceIoControl with the unvalidated parameters 0x9C402440 and 0x9C402444 as IoControlCodes to perform RDMSR and WRMSR, respectively. Through this process, the attacker can modify MSR_LSTAR and hook KiSystemCall64. Afterward, using Return-Oriented Programming (ROP), the attacker can manipulate the stack with pre-prepared gadgets, disable the SMAP flag in the CR4 register, and execute a user-mode syscall handler in the kernel context. It has not been confirmed whether this works on 32-bit Windows, but it functions on 64-bit Windows if the core isolation feature is either absent or disabled.

      <title>CVE-2025-54794 - "Claude Code Directory Traversal Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54794
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 5, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 4 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. In versions below 0.2.111, a path validation flaw using prefix matching instead of canonical path comparison, makes it possible to bypass directory restrictions and access files outside the CWD. Successful exploitation depends on the presence of (or ability to create) a directory with the same prefix as the CWD and the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. This is fixed in version 0.2.111.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54795
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 5, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 4 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Claude Code is an agentic coding tool. In versions below 1.0.20, an error in command parsing makes it possible to bypass the Claude Code confirmation prompt to trigger execution of an untrusted command. Reliably exploiting this requires the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. This is fixed in version 1.0.20.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54802
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 5, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 4 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>pyLoad is the free and open-source Download Manager written in pure Python. In versions 0.5.0b3.dev89 and below, there is an opportunity for path traversal in pyLoad-ng CNL Blueprint via package parameter, allowing Arbitrary File Write which leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The addcrypted endpoint in pyload-ng suffers from an unsafe path construction vulnerability, allowing unauthenticated attackers to write arbitrary files outside the designated storage directory. This can be abused to overwrite critical system files, including cron jobs and systemd services, leading to privilege escalation and remote code execution as root. This issue is fixed in version 0.5.0b3.dev90.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 5, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 20 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>EspoCRM is a web application with a frontend designed as a single-page application and a REST API backend written in PHP. In versions 9.1.6 and below, if a user loads Espo in the browser with double slashes (e.g https://domain//#Admin) and the webserver does not strip the double slash, it can cause a corrupted Slim router's cache. This will make the instance unusable until there is a completed rebuild. This is fixed in version 9.1.7.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53544
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 5, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 20 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Trilium Notes is an open-source, cross-platform hierarchical note taking application with focus on building large personal knowledge bases. In versions below 0.97.0, a brute-force protection bypass in the initial sync seed retrieval endpoint allows unauthenticated attackers to guess the login password without triggering rate limiting. Trilium is a single-user app without a username requirement, and brute-force protection bypass makes exploitation much more feasible. Multiple features provided by Trilium (e.g. MFA, share notes, custom request handler) indicate that Trilium can be exposed to the internet. This is fixed in version 0.97.0.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 5, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 20 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ADOdb is a PHP database class library that provides abstractions for performing queries and managing databases. In versions 5.22.9 and below, improper escaping of a query parameter may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements when the code using ADOdb connects to a sqlite3 database and calls the metaColumns(), metaForeignKeys() or metaIndexes() methods with a crafted table name. This is fixed in version 5.22.10. To workaround this issue, only pass controlled data to metaColumns(), metaForeignKeys() and metaIndexes() method's $table parameter.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 5, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 20 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. Cursor allows writing in-workspace files with no user approval in versions less than 1.3.9. If the file is a dotfile, editing it requires approval but creating a new one doesn't. Hence, if sensitive editor files, such as the .vscode/settings.json file don't already exist in the workspace, an attacker can chain a indirect prompt injection vulnerability to hijack the context to write to the settings file and trigger RCE on the victim without user approval. This is fixed in version 1.3.9.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54387
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 5, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 20 minutes ago

      <title>CVE-2025-7844 - TPM 2.0 Stack Buffer Overflow</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7844
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 4, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Exporting a TPM based RSA key larger than 2048 bits from the TPM could overrun a stack buffer if the default `MAX_RSA_KEY_BITS=2048` is used. If your TPM 2.0 module supports RSA key sizes larger than 2048 bit and your applications supports creating or importing an RSA private or public key larger than 2048 bits and your application calls `wolfTPM2_RsaKey_TpmToWolf` on that key, then a stack buffer could be overrun. If the `MAX_RSA_KEY_BITS` build-time macro is set correctly (RSA bits match what TPM hardware is capable of) for the hardware target, then a stack overrun is not possible.

      <title>CVE-2025-51726 - CyberGhost VPN Weak SHA-1 Signing and Predictable ASLR Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-51726
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 4, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>CyberGhostVPNSetup.exe (Windows installer) is signed using the weak cryptographic hash algorithm SHA-1, which is vulnerable to collision attacks. This allows a malicious actor to craft a fake installer with a forged SHA-1 certificate that may still be accepted by Windows signature verification mechanisms, particularly on systems without strict SmartScreen or trust policy enforcement. Additionally, the installer lacks High Entropy Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), as confirmed by BinSkim (BA2015 rule) and repeated WinDbg analysis. The binary consistently loads into predictable memory ranges, increasing the success rate of memory corruption exploits. These two misconfigurations, when combined, significantly lower the bar for successful supply-chain style attacks or privilege escalation through fake installers.

      <title>CVE-2025-53394 - Macrium Reflect Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53394
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 4, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 51 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Paramount Macrium Reflect through 2025-06-26 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with administrator privileges via a crafted .mrimgx or .mrbax backup file and a renamed executable placed in the same directory. When a user with administrative privileges opens the crafted backup file and proceeds to mount it, Reflect launches the renamed executable (e.g., explorer.exe), which is under attacker control. This occurs because of insufficient validation of companion files referenced during backup mounting.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53395
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 4, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 51 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Paramount Macrium Reflect through 2025-06-26 allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code with administrator privileges via a crafted .mrimgx backup file and a malicious VSSSvr.dll located in the same directory. When a user with administrative privileges mounts a backup by opening the .mrimgx file, Reflect loads the attacker's VSSSvr.dll after the mount completes. This occurs because of untrusted DLL search path behavior in ReflectMonitor.exe.

      <title>CVE-2013-10052 - ZPanel Sudo Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2013-10052
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 4, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 54 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ZPanel includes a helper binary named zsudo, intended to allow restricted privilege escalation for administrative tasks. However, when misconfigured in /etc/sudoers, zsudo can be invoked by low-privileged users to execute arbitrary commands as root. This flaw enables local attackers with shell access to escalate privileges by writing a payload to a writable directory and executing it via zsudo. The vulnerability is particularly impactful in post-exploitation scenarios following web server compromise, where the attacker inherits access to zsudo.

      <title>CVE-2025-54782 - Nest Devtools Integration Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54782
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 2, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 14 hours, 9 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Nest is a framework for building scalable Node.js server-side applications. In versions 0.2.0 and below, a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability was discovered in the @nestjs/devtools-integration package. When enabled, the package exposes a local development HTTP server with an API endpoint that uses an unsafe JavaScript sandbox (safe-eval-like implementation). Due to improper sandboxing and missing cross-origin protections, any malicious website visited by a developer can execute arbitrary code on their local machine. The package adds HTTP endpoints to a locally running NestJS development server. One of these endpoints, /inspector/graph/interact, accepts JSON input containing a code field and executes the provided code in a Node.js vm.runInNewContext sandbox. This is fixed in version 0.2.1.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 2, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 12 hours, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Himmelblau is an interoperability suite for Microsoft Azure Entra ID and Intune. When debugging is enabled for Himmelblau in version 1.0.0, the himmelblaud_tasks service leaks an Intune service access token to the system journal. This short-lived token can be used to detect the host's Intune compliance status, and may permit additional administrative operations for the Intune host device (though the API for these operations is undocumented). This is fixed in version 1.1.0. To workaround this issue, ensure that Himmelblau debugging is disabled.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 2, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 10 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.17 through 1.2, there is a UI information disclosure vulnerability in Cursor's MCP (Model Context Protocol) deeplink handler, allowing attackers to execute 2-click arbitrary system commands through social engineering attacks. When users click malicious `cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install` links, the installation dialog does not show the arguments being passed to the command being run. If a user clicks a malicious deeplink, then examines the installation dialog and clicks through, the full command including the arguments will be executed on the machine. This is fixed in version 1.3.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 2, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 10 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.2.4 and below, attackers can achieve remote and persistent code execution by modifying an already trusted MCP configuration file inside a shared GitHub repository or editing the file locally on the target's machine. Once a collaborator accepts a harmless MCP, the attacker can silently swap it for a malicious command (e.g., calc.exe) without triggering any warning or re-prompt. If an attacker has write permissions on a user's active branches of a source repository that contains existing MCP servers the user has previously approved, or allows an attacker has arbitrary file-write locally, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution. This is fixed in version 1.3.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 1, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>LocalSend is an open-source app to securely share files and messages with nearby devices over local networks without needing an internet connection. In versions 1.16.1 and below, a critical Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) vulnerability in the software's discovery protocol allows an unauthenticated attacker on the same local network to impersonate legitimate devices, silently intercepting, reading, and modifying any file transfer. This can be used to steal sensitive data or inject malware, like ransomware, into files shared between trusted users. The attack is hardly detectable and easy to implement, posing a severe and immediate security risk. This issue was fixed in version 1.17.0.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 1, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions below 1.3, an attacker can bypass the allow list in auto-run mode with a backtick (`) or $(cmd). If a user has swapped Cursor from its default settings (requiring approval for every terminal call) to an allowlist, an attacker can execute arbitrary command execution outside of the allowlist without user approval. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability if chained with indirect prompt injection. This is fixed in version 1.3.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 1, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions below 1.3, Mermaid (which is used to render diagrams) allows embedding images which then get rendered by Cursor in the chat box. An attacker can use this to exfiltrate sensitive information to a third-party attacker controlled server through an image fetch after successfully performing a prompt injection. A malicious model (or hallucination/backdoor) might also trigger this exploit at will. This issue requires prompt injection from malicious data (web, image upload, source code) in order to exploit. In that case, it can send sensitive information to an attacker-controlled external server. This is fixed in version 1.3.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53012
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 1, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 49 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>MaterialX is an open standard for the exchange of rich material and look-development content across applications and renderers. In version 1.39.2, nested imports of MaterialX files can lead to a crash via stack memory exhaustion, due to the lack of a limit on the "import chain" depth. When parsing file imports, recursion is used to process nested files; however, there is no limit imposed to the depth of files that can be parsed by the library. By building a sufficiently deep chain of MaterialX files one referencing the next, it is possible to crash the process using the MaterialX library via stack exhaustion. This is fixed in version 1.39.3.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 1, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 49 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>webfinger.js is a TypeScript-based WebFinger client that runs in both browsers and Node.js environments. In versions 2.8.0 and below, the lookup function accepts user addresses for account checking. However, the ActivityPub specification requires preventing access to localhost services in production. This library does not prevent localhost access, only checking for hosts that start with "localhost" and end with a port. Users can exploit this by creating servers that send GET requests with controlled host, path, and port parameters to query services on the instance's host or local network, enabling blind SSRF attacks. This is fixed in version 2.8.1.

<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 1, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 49 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Pearcleaner is a free, source-available and fair-code licensed mac app cleaner. The PearcleanerHelper is a privileged helper tool bundled with the Pearcleaner application. It is registered and activated only after the user approves a system prompt to allow privileged operations. Upon approval, the helper is configured as a LaunchDaemon and runs with root privileges. In versions 4.4.0 through 4.5.1, the helper registers an XPC service (com.alienator88.Pearcleaner.PearcleanerHelper) and accepts unauthenticated connections from any local process. It exposes a method that executes arbitrary shell commands. This allows any local unprivileged user to escalate privileges to root once the helper is approved and active. This issue is fixed in version 4.5.2.

      <title>CVE-2025-50460 - Apache Ms-Swift Remote Code Execution (RCE)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-50460
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 2 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the ms-swift project version 3.3.0 due to unsafe deserialization in tests/run.py using yaml.load() from the PyYAML library (versions = 5.3.1). If an attacker can control the content of the YAML configuration file passed to the --run_config parameter, arbitrary code can be executed during deserialization. This can lead to full system compromise. The vulnerability is triggered when a malicious YAML file is loaded, allowing the execution of arbitrary Python commands such as os.system(). It is recommended to upgrade PyYAML to version 5.4 or higher, and to use yaml.safe_load() to mitigate the issue.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-50472
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 2 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The modelscope/ms-swift library thru 2.6.1 is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution through deserialization of untrusted data within the `load_model_meta()` function of the `ModelFileSystemCache()` class. Attackers can execute arbitrary code and commands by crafting a malicious serialized `.mdl` payload, exploiting the use of `pickle.load()` on data from potentially untrusted sources. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) by deceiving victims into loading a seemingly harmless checkpoint during a normal training process, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine. Note that the payload file is a hidden file, making it difficult for the victim to detect tampering. More importantly, during the model training process, after the `.mdl` file is loaded and executes arbitrary code, the normal training process remains unaffected'meaning the user remains unaware of the arbitrary code execution.

      <title>CVE-2025-53399 - Sipwise RTPengine RTP Stream Injection and Interception Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53399
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> Aug. 1, 2025, 4:16 a.m. | 2 hours, 49 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In Sipwise rtpengine before 13.4.1.1, an origin-validation error in the endpoint-learning logic of the media-relay core allows remote attackers to inject or intercept RTP/SRTP media streams via RTP packets (except when the relay is configured for strict source and learning disabled). Version 13.4.1.1 fixes the heuristic mode by limiting exposure to the first five packets, and introduces a recrypt flag that fully prevents SRTP attacks when both mitigations are enabled.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 31, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 7 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability has been identified in the Linux kernel's ksmbd component (kernel SMB/CIFS server). A security control designed to prevent dictionary attacks, which introduces a 5-second delay during session setup, can be bypassed through the use of asynchronous requests. This bypass negates the intended anti-brute-force protection, potentially allowing attackers to conduct dictionary attacks more efficiently against user credentials or other authentication mechanisms.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 31, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Array Networks vAPV (version 8.3.2.17) and vxAG (version 9.2.0.34) appliances are affected by a privilege escalation vulnerability caused by a combination of hardcoded SSH credentials (or SSH private key) and insecure permissions on a startup script. The devices ship with a default SSH login or a hardcoded DSA private key, allowing an attacker to authenticate remotely with limited privileges.


Once authenticated, an attacker can overwrite the world-writable /ca/bin/monitor.sh script with arbitrary commands. Since this script is executed with elevated privileges through the backend binary, enabling the debug monitor via backend -c "debug monitor on" triggers execution of the attacker's payload as root. This allows full system compromise.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 31, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the tmUnblock.cgi endpoint of the Linksys WRT120N wireless router. The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request with an overly long TM_Block_URL parameter to the endpoint.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 31, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in the Kloxo web hosting control panel (developed by LXCenter) prior to version 6.1.12. The flaw resides in the login-name parameter passed to lbin/webcommand.php, which fails to properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to extract the administrator’s password from the backend database. After recovering valid credentials, the attacker can authenticate to the Kloxo control panel and leverage the Command Center feature (display.php) to execute arbitrary operating system commands as root on the underlying host system. This vulnerability was reported to be exploited in the wild in January 2014.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 31, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability exists in Pandora FMS versions up to and including 5.0RC1 via the Anyterm web interface, which listens on TCP port 8023. The anyterm-module endpoint accepts unsanitized user input via the p parameter and directly injects it into a shell command, allowing arbitrary command execution as the pandora user. In certain versions (notably 4.1 and 5.0RC1), the pandora user can elevate privileges to root without a password using a chain involving the artica user account. This account is typically installed without a password and is configured to run sudo without authentication. Therefore, full system compromise is possible without any credentials.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 31, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A path traversal vulnerability exists in A10 Networks AX Loadbalancer versions 2.6.1-GR1-P5, 2.7.0, and earlier. The vulnerability resides in the handling of the filename parameter in the /xml/downloads endpoint, which fails to properly sanitize user input. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this flaw by sending crafted HTTP requests containing directory traversal sequences to read arbitrary files outside the intended directory. The files returned by the vulnerable endpoint are deleted from the system after retrieval. This can lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information such as SSL certificates and private keys, as well as unintended file deletion.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 31, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unrestricted file upload vulnerability exists in Simple E-Document versions 3.0 to 3.1 that allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication by sending a specific cookie header (access=3) with HTTP requests. The application’s upload mechanism fails to restrict file types and does not validate or sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to upload malicious .php scripts. Authentication can be bypassed entirely by supplying a specially crafted cookie (access=3), granting access to the upload functionality without valid credentials. If file uploads are enabled on the server, the attacker can upload a web shell and gain remote code execution with the privileges of the web server user, potentially leading to full system compromise.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2013-10034
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 31, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unrestricted file upload vulnerability exists in Kaseya KServer versions prior to 6.3.0.2. The uploadImage.asp endpoint allows unauthenticated users to upload files to arbitrary paths via a crafted filename parameter in a multipart/form-data POST request. Due to the lack of authentication and input sanitation, an attacker can upload a file with an .asp extension to a web-accessible directory, which can then be invoked to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the IUSR account. The vulnerability enables remote code execution without prior authentication and was resolved in version 6.3.0.2 by removing the vulnerable uploadImage.asp endpoint.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2013-10035
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 31, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A code injection vulnerability exists in ProcessMaker Open Source versions 2.x when using the default 'neoclassic' skin. An authenticated user can execute arbitrary PHP code via multiple endpoints, including appFolderAjax.php, casesStartPage_Ajax.php, and cases_SchedulerGetPlugins.php, by supplying crafted POST requests to parameters such as action and params. These endpoints fail to validate user input and directly invoke PHP functions like system() with user-supplied parameters, enabling remote code execution. The vulnerability affects both Linux and Windows installations and is present in default configurations of versions including 2.0.23 through 2.5.1. The vulnerable skin cannot be removed through the web interface, and exploitation requires only valid user credentials.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54586
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 30, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 9 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>GitProxy is an application that stands between developers and a Git remote endpoint. In versions 1.19.1 and below,   attackers can inject extra commits into the pack sent to GitHub, commits that aren’t pointed to by any branch. Although these “hidden” commits never show up in the repository’s visible history, GitHub still serves them at their direct commit URLs. This lets an attacker exfiltrate sensitive data without ever leaving a trace in the branch view. We rate this a High‑impact vulnerability because it completely compromises repository confidentiality. This is fixed in version 1.19.2.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54585
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 30, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 9 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>GitProxy is an application that stands between developers and a Git remote endpoint. In versions 1.19.1 and below, attackers can exploit the way GitProxy handles new branch creation to bypass the approval of prior commits on the parent branch. The vulnerability impacts all users or organizations relying on GitProxy to enforce policy and prevent unapproved changes. It requires no elevated privileges beyond regular push access, and no extra user interaction. It does however, require a GitProxy administrator or designated user (canUserApproveRejectPush) to approve pushes to the child branch. This is fixed in version 1.19.2.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54583
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 30, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 7 hours, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>GitProxy is an application that stands between developers and a Git remote endpoint (e.g., github.com). Versions 1.19.1 and below allow users to push to remote repositories while bypassing policies and explicit approvals. Since checks and plugins are skipped, code containing secrets or unwanted changes could be pushed into a repository. This is fixed in version 1.19.2.

      <title>CVE-2025-54584 - GitProxy Git Packfile Signature Bypass Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54584
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 30, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 7 hours, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>GitProxy is an application that stands between developers and a Git remote endpoint (e.g., github.com). In versions 1.19.1 and below, an attacker can craft a malicious Git packfile to exploit the PACK signature detection in the parsePush.ts file. By embedding a misleading PACK signature within commit content and carefully constructing the packet structure, the attacker can trick the parser into treating invalid or unintended data as the packfile. Potentially, this would allow bypassing approval or hiding commits. This issue is fixed in version 1.19.2.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54575
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 30, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 49 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ImageSharp is a 2D graphics library. In versions below 2.1.11 and 3.0.0 through 3.1.10, a specially crafted GIF file containing a malformed comment extension block (with a missing block terminator) can cause the ImageSharp GIF decoder to enter an infinite loop while attempting to skip the block. This leads to a denial of service. Applications processing untrusted GIF input should upgrade to a patched version. This issue is fixed in versions 2.1.11 and 3.1.11.

      <title>CVE-2025-54576 - OAuth2-Proxy Regex Pattern Bypass Authentication Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54576
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 30, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 49 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>OAuth2-Proxy is an open-source tool that can act as either a standalone reverse proxy or a middleware component integrated into existing reverse proxy or load balancer setups. In versions 7.10.0 and below, oauth2-proxy deployments are vulnerable when using the skip_auth_routes configuration option with regex patterns. Attackers can bypass authentication by crafting URLs with query parameters that satisfy configured regex patterns, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources. The issue stems from skip_auth_routes matching against the full request URI. Deployments using skip_auth_routes with regex patterns containing wildcards or broad matching patterns are most at risk. This issue is fixed in version 7.11.0. Workarounds include: auditing all skip_auth_routes configurations for overly permissive patterns, replacing wildcard patterns with exact path matches where possible, ensuring regex patterns are properly anchored (starting with ^ and ending with $), or implementing custom validation that strips query parameters before regex matching.

      <title>CVE-2025-54581 - Vproxy HTTP Proxy-Authorization Header DoS Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54581
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 30, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 49 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>vproxy is an HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5 proxy server. In versions 2.3.3 and below, untrusted data is extracted from the user-controlled HTTP Proxy-Authorization header and passed to Extension::try_from and flows into parse_ttl_extension where it is parsed as a TTL value. If an attacker supplies a TTL of zero (e.g. by using a username such as 'configuredUser-ttl-0'), the modulo operation 'timestamp % ttl' will cause a division by zero panic, causing the server to crash causing a denial-of-service. This is fixed in version 2.4.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-53022 - TrustedFirmware-M Stack Buffer Overflow</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53022
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 30, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 29 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>TrustedFirmware-M (aka Trusted Firmware for M profile Arm CPUs) before 2.1.3 and 2.2.x before 2.2.1 lacks length validation during a firmware upgrade. While processing a new image, the Firmware Upgrade (FWU) module does not validate the length field of the Type-Length-Value (TLV) structure for dependent components against the maximum allowed size. If the length specified in the TLV exceeds the size of the buffer allocated on the stack, the FWU module will overwrite the buffer (and potentially other stack data) with the TLV's value content. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious TLV entry in the unprotected section of the MCUBoot upgrade image. By setting the length field to exceed the expected structure size, the attacker can manipulate the stack memory of the system during the upgrade process.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the upload.cgi module of the iptime NAS firmware v1.5.04. The vulnerability arises due to the unsafe use of the strcpy function to copy attacker-controlled data from the CONTENT_TYPE HTTP header into a fixed-size stack buffer (v8, allocated 8 bytes) without bounds checking. Since this operation occurs before authentication logic is executed, the vulnerability is exploitable pre-authentication.

      <title>CVE-2025-54656 - Apache Struts LookupDispatchAction Log Injection</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54656
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 30, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 49 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Improper Output Neutralization for Logs vulnerability in Apache Struts.

This issue affects Apache Struts Extras: before 2.

When using LookupDispatchAction, in some cases, Struts may print untrusted input to the logs without any filtering. Specially-crafted input may lead to log output where part of the message masquerades as a separate log line, confusing consumers of the logs (either human or automated). 

As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.

NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.

      <title>CVE-2025-53944 - AutoGPT Authorization Bypass Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53944
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 30, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 49 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents. In v0.6.15 and below, the external API's get_graph_execution_results endpoint has an authorization bypass vulnerability. While it correctly validates user access to the graph_id, it fails to verify ownership of the graph_exec_id parameter, allowing authenticated users to access any execution results by providing arbitrary execution IDs. The internal API implements proper validation for both parameters. This is fixed in v0.6.16.

      <title>CVE-2025-54433 - Bugsink File Path Traversal Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54433
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 30, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 49 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Bugsink is a self-hosted error tracking service. In versions 1.4.2 and below, 1.5.0 through 1.5.4, 1.6.0 through 1.6.3, and 1.7.0 through 1.7.3,  ingestion paths construct file locations directly from untrusted event_id input without validation. A specially crafted event_id can result in paths outside the intended directory, potentially allowing file overwrite or creation in arbitrary locations. Submitting such input requires access to a valid DSN, potentially exposing them. If Bugsink runs in a container, the effect is confined to the container’s filesystem. In non-containerized setups, the overwrite may affect other parts of the system accessible to that user. This is fixed in versions 1.4.3, 1.5.5, 1.6.4 and 1.7.4.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54573
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 30, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 49 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>CVAT is an open source interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. In versions 1.1.0 through 2.41.0, email verification was not enforced when using Basic HTTP Authentication. As a result, users could create accounts using fake email addresses and use the product as verified users. Additionally, the missing email verification check leaves the system open to bot signups and further usage. CVAT 2.42.0 and later versions contain a fix for the issue. CVAT Enterprise customers have a workaround available; those customers may disable registration to prevent this issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-54410 - Docker Moby Firewalld Container Isolation Bypass</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54410
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 30, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 26 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Moby is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker Engine, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. A firewalld vulnerability affects Moby releases before 28.0.0. When firewalld reloads, Docker fails to re-create iptables rules that isolate bridge networks, allowing any container to access all ports on any other container across different bridge networks on the same host. This breaks network segmentation between containers that should be isolated, creating significant risk in multi-tenant environments. Only containers in --internal networks remain protected.
Workarounds include reloading firewalld and either restarting the docker daemon, re-creating bridge networks, or using rootless mode. Maintainers anticipate a fix for this issue in version 25.0.13.

      <title>CVE-2025-54425 - Umbraco Content Delivery API Cache Bypass Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54425
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 30, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 26 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Umbraco is an ASP.NET CMS. In versions 13.0.0 through 13.9.2, 15.0.0 through 15.4.1 and 16.0.0 through 16.1.0, the content delivery API can be restricted from public access where an API key must be provided in a header to authorize the request. It's also possible to configure output caching, such that the delivery API outputs will be cached for a period of time, improving performance. There's an issue when these two things are used together, where caching doesn't vary by the header that contains the API key. As such, it's possible for a user without a valid API key to retrieve a response for a given path and query if it has recently been requested and cached by request with a valid key. This is fixed in versions 13.9.3, 15.4.4 and 16.1.1.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54430
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 30, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 26 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>dedupe is a python library that uses machine learning to perform fuzzy matching, deduplication and entity resolution quickly on structured data. Before commit 3f61e79, a critical severity vulnerability has been identified within the .github/workflows/benchmark-bot.yml workflow, where a issue_comment can be triggered using the @benchmark body. This workflow is susceptible to exploitation as it checkout the ${{ github.event.issue.number }}, which correspond to the branch of the PR manipulated by potentially malicious actors, and where untrusted code may be executed. Running untrusted code may lead to the exfiltration of GITHUB_TOKEN, which in this workflow has write permissions on most of the scopes - in particular the contents one - and could lead to potential repository takeover. This is fixed by commit 3f61e79.

      <title>CVE-2025-54388 - Docker Moby iptables Rule Deletion and Recreation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54388
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 30, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Moby is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker Engine, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. In versions 28.2.0 through 28.3.2, when the firewalld service is reloaded it removes all iptables rules including those created by Docker. While Docker should automatically recreate these rules, versions before 28.3.3 fail to recreate the specific rules that block external access to containers. This means that after a firewalld reload, containers with ports published to localhost (like 127.0.0.1:8080) become accessible from remote machines that have network routing to the Docker bridge, even though they should only be accessible from the host itself. The vulnerability only affects explicitly published ports - unpublished ports remain protected. This issue is fixed in version 28.3.3.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54126
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 29, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 49 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The WebAssembly Micro Runtime's (WAMR) iwasm package is the executable binary built with WAMR VMcore which supports WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) and command line interface. In versions 2.4.0 and below, iwasm uses --addr-pool with an IPv4 address that lacks a subnet mask, allowing the system to accept all IP addresses. This can unintentionally expose the service to all incoming connections and bypass intended access restrictions. Services relying on --addr-pool for restricting access by IP may unintentionally become open to all external connections. This may lead to unauthorized access in production deployments, especially when users assume that specifying an IP without a subnet mask implies a default secure configuration. This is fixed in version 2.4.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-5922 - TSplus Remote Access Admin Tool Unsalted PIN Hash Leak</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-5922
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 29, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 49 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Access to TSplus Remote Access Admin Tool is restricted to administrators (unless "Disable UAC" option is enabled) and requires a PIN code. In versions below v18.40.6.17 the PIN's hash is stored in a system registry accessible to regular users, making it possible to perform a brute-force attack using rainbow tables, since the hash is not salted.
LTS (Long-Term Support) versions also received patches in v17.2025.6.27 and v16.2025.6.27 releases.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Memos application, up to version v0.24.3, allows for the embedding of markdown images with arbitrary URLs. When a user views a memo containing such an image, their browser automatically fetches the image URL without explicit user consent or interaction beyond viewing the memo. This can be exploited by an attacker to disclose the viewing user's IP address, browser User-Agent string, and potentially other request-specific information to the attacker-controlled server, leading to information disclosure and user tracking.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54422
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 29, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 49 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. In versions 1.16.1 and below, a critical security vulnerability exists in password handling mechanisms. During encrypted sandbox creation, user passwords are transmitted via shared memory, exposing them to potential interception. The vulnerability is particularly severe during password modification operations, where both old and new passwords are passed as plaintext command-line arguments to the Imbox process without any encryption or obfuscation. This implementation flaw allows any process within the user session, including unprivileged processes, to retrieve these sensitive credentials by reading the command-line arguments, thereby bypassing standard privilege requirements and creating a significant security risk. This is fixed in version 1.16.2.

      <title>CVE-2025-54426 - Polkadot Frontier Curve25519 Precompute Invalid Input Handling</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54426
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 8 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Polkadot Frontier is an Ethereum and EVM compatibility layer for Polkadot and Substrate. In versions prior to commit 36f70d1, the Curve25519Add and Curve25519ScalarMul precompiles incorrectly handle invalid Ristretto point representations. Instead of returning an error, they silently treat invalid input bytes as the Ristretto identity element, leading to potentially incorrect cryptographic results. This is fixed in commit 36f70d1.

      <title>CVE-2025-54427 - Polkadot Frontier EVM Gas Price Manipulation Denial-of-Service</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54427
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 8 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Polkadot Frontier is an Ethereum and EVM compatibility layer for Polkadot and Substrate. The extrinsic note_min_gas_price_target is an inherent extrinsic, meaning only the block producer can call it. To ensure correctness, the ProvideInherent trait should be implemented for each inherent, which includes the check_inherent call. This allows other nodes to verify if the input (in this case, the target value) is correct. However, prior to commit a754b3d, the check_inherent function has not been implemented for note_min_gas_price_target. This lets the block producer set the target value without verification. The target is then used to set the MinGasPrice, which has an upper and lower bound defined in the on_initialize hook. The block producer can set the target to the upper bound. Which also increases the upper and lower bounds for the next block. Over time, this could result in continuously raising the gas price, making contract execution too expensive and ineffective for users. An attacker could use this flaw to manipulate the gas price, potentially leading to significantly inflated transaction fees. Such manipulation could render contract execution prohibitively expensive for users, effectively resulting in a denial-of-service condition for the network. This is fixed in version a754b3d.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54428
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 8 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>RevelaCode is an AI-powered faith-tech project that decodes biblical verses, prophecies and global events into accessible language. In versions below 1.0.1, a valid MongoDB Atlas URI with embedded username and password was accidentally committed to the public repository. This could allow unauthorized access to production or staging databases, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. This is fixed in version 1.0.1. Workarounds include: immediately rotating credentials for the exposed database user, using a secret manager (like Vault, Doppler, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) instead of storing secrets directly in code, or auditing recent access logs for suspicious activity.

      <title>CVE-2025-54429 - Polkadot Frontier CallableByContract AddressType Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54429
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 8 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Polkadot Frontier is an Ethereum and EVM compatibility layer for Polkadot and Substrate. There are various account address types in Frontier, e.g. precompiled contracts, smart contracts, and externally owned accounts. Some EVM mechanisms should be unreachable by certain types of accounts for safety. For precompiles to be callable by smart contracts they must be explicitly configured as CallableByContract. If this configuration is absent, then the precompile should be unreachable via smart contract accounts. In commits prior to 0822030, the underlying implementation of CallableByContract which returned the AddressType was incorrect. It considered the contract address running under CREATE or CREATE2 to be AddressType::EOA rather than correctly as AddressType::Contract. The issue only affects users who use custom precompile implementations that utilize AddressType::EOA and AddressType::Contract. It's not directly exploitable in any of the predefined precompiles in Frontier. This is fixed in version 0822030.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 8:17 p.m. | 8 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A SAML library not dependent on any frameworks that runs in Node. In version 5.0.1, Node-SAML loads the assertion from the (unsigned) original response document. This is different than the parts that are verified when checking signature. This allows an attacker to modify authentication details within a valid SAML assertion. For example, in one attack it is possible to remove any character from the SAML assertion username. To conduct the attack an attacker would need a validly signed document from the identity provider (IdP). This is fixed in version 5.1.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-8194 - Apache CPython TarFile Infinite Loop Deadlock</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-8194
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 10 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>There is a defect in the CPython “tarfile” module affecting the “TarFile” extraction and entry enumeration APIs. The tar implementation would process tar archives with negative offsets without error, resulting in an infinite loop and deadlock during the parsing of maliciously crafted tar archives. 

This vulnerability can be mitigated by including the following patch after importing the “tarfile” module:



import tarfile

def _block_patched(self, count):
    if count < 0:  # pragma: no cover
        raise tarfile.InvalidHeaderError("invalid offset")
    return _block_patched._orig_block(self, count)

_block_patched._orig_block = tarfile.TarInfo._block
tarfile.TarInfo._block = _block_patched

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-8283
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 10 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability was found in the netavark package, a network stack for containers used with Podman. Due to dns.podman search domain being removed, netavark may return external servers if a valid A/AAAA record is sent as a response. When creating a container with a given name, this name will be used as the hostname for the container itself, as the podman's search domain is not added anymore the container is using the host's resolv.conf, and the DNS resolver will try to look into the search domains contained on it. If one of the domains contain a name with the same hostname as the running container, the connection will forward to unexpected external servers.

      <title>CVE-2025-54418 - CodeIgniter ImageMagick Command Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54418
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 14 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. A command injection vulnerability present in versions prior to 4.6.2 affects applications that use the ImageMagick handler for image processing (`imagick` as the image library) and either allow file uploads with user-controlled filenames and process uploaded images using the `resize()` method or use the `text()` method with user-controlled text content or options. An attacker can upload a file with a malicious filename containing shell metacharacters that get executed when the image is processed or provide malicious text content or options that get executed when adding text to images Users should upgrade to v4.6.2 or later to receive a patch. As a workaround, switch to the GD image handler (`gd`, the default handler), which is not affected by either vulnerability. For file upload scenarios, instead of using user-provided filenames, generate random names to eliminate the attack vector with `getRandomName()` when using the `move()` method, or use the `store()` method, which automatically generates safe filenames. For text operations, if one must use ImageMagick with user-controlled text, sanitize the input to only allow safe characters and validate/restrict text options.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38497
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 47 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: configfs: Fix OOB read on empty string write

When writing an empty string to either 'qw_sign' or 'landingPage'
sysfs attributes, the store functions attempt to access page[l - 1]
before validating that the length 'l' is greater than zero.

This patch fixes the vulnerability by adding a check at the beginning
of os_desc_qw_sign_store() and webusb_landingPage_store() to handle
the zero-length input case gracefully by returning immediately.

      <title>CVE-2025-38488 - Linux Samba SMB Client Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38488
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix use-after-free in crypt_message when using async crypto

The CVE-2024-50047 fix removed asynchronous crypto handling from
crypt_message(), assuming all crypto operations are synchronous.
However, when hardware crypto accelerators are used, this can cause
use-after-free crashes:

  crypt_message()
    // Allocate the creq buffer containing the req
    creq = smb2_get_aead_req(..., &req);

    // Async encryption returns -EINPROGRESS immediately
    rc = enc ? crypto_aead_encrypt(req) : crypto_aead_decrypt(req);

    // Free creq while async operation is still in progress
    kvfree_sensitive(creq, ...);

Hardware crypto modules often implement async AEAD operations for
performance. When crypto_aead_encrypt/decrypt() returns -EINPROGRESS,
the operation completes asynchronously. Without crypto_wait_req(),
the function immediately frees the request buffer, leading to crashes
when the driver later accesses the freed memory.

This results in a use-after-free condition when the hardware crypto
driver later accesses the freed request structure, leading to kernel
crashes with NULL pointer dereferences.

The issue occurs because crypto_alloc_aead() with mask=0 doesn't
guarantee synchronous operation. Even without CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC in
the mask, async implementations can be selected.

Fix by restoring the async crypto handling:
- DECLARE_CRYPTO_WAIT(wait) for completion tracking
- aead_request_set_callback() for async completion notification
- crypto_wait_req() to wait for operation completion

This ensures the request buffer isn't freed until the crypto operation
completes, whether synchronous or asynchronous, while preserving the
CVE-2024-50047 fix.

      <title>CVE-2025-38492 - Linux Kernel Netfs ALL_QUEUED Race Condition Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38492
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfs: Fix race between cache write completion and ALL_QUEUED being set

When netfslib is issuing subrequests, the subrequests start processing
immediately and may complete before we reach the end of the issuing
function.  At the end of the issuing function we set NETFS_RREQ_ALL_QUEUED
to indicate to the collector that we aren't going to issue any more subreqs
and that it can do the final notifications and cleanup.

Now, this isn't a problem if the request is synchronous
(NETFS_RREQ_OFFLOAD_COLLECTION is unset) as the result collection will be
done in-thread and we're guaranteed an opportunity to run the collector.

However, if the request is asynchronous, collection is primarily triggered
by the termination of subrequests queuing it on a workqueue.  Now, a race
can occur here if the app thread sets ALL_QUEUED after the last subrequest
terminates.

This can happen most easily with the copy2cache code (as used by Ceph)
where, in the collection routine of a read request, an asynchronous write
request is spawned to copy data to the cache.  Folios are added to the
write request as they're unlocked, but there may be a delay before
ALL_QUEUED is set as the write subrequests may complete before we get
there.

If all the write subreqs have finished by the ALL_QUEUED point, no further
events happen and the collection never happens, leaving the request
hanging.

Fix this by queuing the collector after setting ALL_QUEUED.  This is a bit
heavy-handed and it may be sufficient to do it only if there are no extant
subreqs.

Also add a tracepoint to cross-reference both requests in a copy-to-request
operation and add a trace to the netfs_rreq tracepoint to indicate the
setting of ALL_QUEUED.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing/osnoise: Fix crash in timerlat_dump_stack()

We have observed kernel panics when using timerlat with stack saving,
with the following dmesg output:

memcpy: detected buffer overflow: 88 byte write of buffer size 0
WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 8153 at lib/string_helpers.c:1032 __fortify_report+0x55/0xa0

__timerlat_dump_stack() constructs the ftrace stack entry like this:

struct stack_entry *entry;
...
memcpy(&entry->caller, fstack->calls, size);
entry->size = fstack->nr_entries;

Since commit e7186af7fb26 ("tracing: Add back FORTIFY_SOURCE logic to
kernel_stack event structure"), struct stack_entry marks its caller
field with __counted_by(size). At the time of the memcpy, entry->size
contains garbage from the ringbuffer, which under some circumstances is
zero, triggering a kernel panic by buffer overflow.

Populate the size field before the memcpy so that the out-of-bounds
check knows the correct size. This is analogous to
__ftrace_trace_stack().

      <title>CVE-2025-38475 - Android Linux SMC Socket Type Confusion Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38475
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smc: Fix various oops due to inet_sock type confusion.

syzbot reported weird splats [0][1] in cipso_v4_sock_setattr() while
freeing inet_sk(sk)->inet_opt.

The address was freed multiple times even though it was read-only memory.

cipso_v4_sock_setattr() did nothing wrong, and the root cause was type
confusion.

The cited commit made it possible to create smc_sock as an INET socket.

The issue is that struct smc_sock does not have struct inet_sock as the
first member but hijacks AF_INET and AF_INET6 sk_family, which confuses
various places.

In this case, inet_sock.inet_opt was actually smc_sock.clcsk_data_ready(),
which is an address of a function in the text segment.

  $ pahole -C inet_sock vmlinux
  struct inet_sock {
  ...
          struct ip_options_rcu *    inet_opt;             /*   784     8 */

  $ pahole -C smc_sock vmlinux
  struct smc_sock {
  ...
          void                       (*clcsk_data_ready)(struct sock *); /*   784     8 */

The same issue for another field was reported before. [2][3]

At that time, an ugly hack was suggested [4], but it makes both INET
and SMC code error-prone and hard to change.

Also, yet another variant was fixed by a hacky commit 98d4435efcbf3
("net/smc: prevent NULL pointer dereference in txopt_get").

Instead of papering over the root cause by such hacks, we should not
allow non-INET socket to reuse the INET infra.

Let's add inet_sock as the first member of smc_sock.

      <title>CVE-2025-38476 - Linux kernel RPL Use-after-free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38476
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rpl: Fix use-after-free in rpl_do_srh_inline().

Running lwt_dst_cache_ref_loop.sh in selftest with KASAN triggers
the splat below [0].

rpl_do_srh_inline() fetches ipv6_hdr(skb) and accesses it after
skb_cow_head(), which is illegal as the header could be freed then.

Let's fix it by making oldhdr to a local struct instead of a pointer.

      <title>CVE-2025-38477 - Linux Kernel sch_qfq Race Condition Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38477
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: sch_qfq: Fix race condition on qfq_aggregate

A race condition can occur when 'agg' is modified in qfq_change_agg
(called during qfq_enqueue) while other threads access it
concurrently. For example, qfq_dump_class may trigger a NULL
dereference, and qfq_delete_class may cause a use-after-free.

This patch addresses the issue by:

1. Moved qfq_destroy_class into the critical section.

2. Added sch_tree_lock protection to qfq_dump_class and
qfq_dump_class_stats.

      <title>CVE-2025-38478 - Linux Comedi Uninitialized Data Access Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38478
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Fix initialization of data for instructions that write to subdevice

Some Comedi subdevice instruction handlers are known to access
instruction data elements beyond the first `insn->n` elements in some
cases.  The `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` functions
allocate at least `MIN_SAMPLES` (16) data elements to deal with this,
but they do not initialize all of that.  For Comedi instruction codes
that write to the subdevice, the first `insn->n` data elements are
copied from user-space, but the remaining elements are left
uninitialized.  That could be a problem if the subdevice instruction
handler reads the uninitialized data.  Ensure that the first
`MIN_SAMPLES` elements are initialized before calling these instruction
handlers, filling the uncopied elements with 0.  For
`do_insnlist_ioctl()`, the same data buffer elements are used for
handling a list of instructions, so ensure the first `MIN_SAMPLES`
elements are initialized for each instruction that writes to the
subdevice.

      <title>CVE-2025-38480 - Comedi Uninitialized Data Exposure Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38480
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Fix use of uninitialized data in insn_rw_emulate_bits()

For Comedi `INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE` instructions on "digital"
subdevices (subdevice types `COMEDI_SUBD_DI`, `COMEDI_SUBD_DO`, and
`COMEDI_SUBD_DIO`), it is common for the subdevice driver not to have
`insn_read` and `insn_write` handler functions, but to have an
`insn_bits` handler function for handling Comedi `INSN_BITS`
instructions.  In that case, the subdevice's `insn_read` and/or
`insn_write` function handler pointers are set to point to the
`insn_rw_emulate_bits()` function by `__comedi_device_postconfig()`.

For `INSN_WRITE`, `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` currently assumes that the
supplied `data[0]` value is a valid copy from user memory.  It will at
least exist because `do_insnlist_ioctl()` and `do_insn_ioctl()` in
"comedi_fops.c" ensure at lease `MIN_SAMPLES` (16) elements are
allocated.  However, if `insn->n` is 0 (which is allowable for
`INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE` instructions, then `data[0]` may contain
uninitialized data, and certainly contains invalid data, possibly from a
different instruction in the array of instructions handled by
`do_insnlist_ioctl()`.  This will result in an incorrect value being
written to the digital output channel (or to the digital input/output
channel if configured as an output), and may be reflected in the
internal saved state of the channel.

Fix it by returning 0 early if `insn->n` is 0, before reaching the code
that accesses `data[0]`.  Previously, the function always returned 1 on
success, but it is supposed to be the number of data samples actually
read or written up to `insn->n`, which is 0 in this case.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38481
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Fail COMEDI_INSNLIST ioctl if n_insns is too large

The handling of the `COMEDI_INSNLIST` ioctl allocates a kernel buffer to
hold the array of `struct comedi_insn`, getting the length from the
`n_insns` member of the `struct comedi_insnlist` supplied by the user.
The allocation will fail with a WARNING and a stack dump if it is too
large.

Avoid that by failing with an `-EINVAL` error if the supplied `n_insns`
value is unreasonable.

Define the limit on the `n_insns` value in the `MAX_INSNS` macro.  Set
this to the same value as `MAX_SAMPLES` (65536), which is the maximum
allowed sum of the values of the member `n` in the array of `struct
comedi_insn`, and sensible comedi instructions will have an `n` of at
least 1.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: das6402: Fix bit shift out of bounds

When checking for a supported IRQ number, the following test is used:

	/* IRQs 2,3,5,6,7, 10,11,15 are valid for "enhanced" mode */
	if ((1 << it->options[1]) & 0x8cec) {

However, `it->options[i]` is an unchecked `int` value from userspace, so
the shift amount could be negative or out of bounds.  Fix the test by
requiring `it->options[1]` to be within bounds before proceeding with
the original test.  Valid `it->options[1]` values that select the IRQ
will be in the range [1,15]. The value 0 explicitly disables the use of
interrupts.

Dan has also reported following issues with the original patch
https://lore.kernel.org/all/33fe8fe7-719a-405a-9ed2-d9f816ce1d57@sabinyo.mountain/

Bug #1:
The zeroeth element of ctrl->pconfig[] is supposed to be unused.  We
start counting at 1.  However this code sets ctrl->pconfig[0].ch_mask = 128.

Bug #2:
There are SLIM_MAX_TX_PORTS (16) elements in tx_ch[] array but only
QCOM_SDW_MAX_PORTS + 1 (15) in the ctrl->pconfig[] array so it corrupts
memory like Yongqin Liu pointed out.

Bug 3:
Like Jie Gan pointed out, it erases all the tx information with the rx
information.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-27800
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 28, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Episerver Content Management System (CMS) by Optimizely was affected by multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This allowed an authenticated attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.



The Admin dashboard offered the functionality to add gadgets to the dashboard.
This included the "Notes" gadget. An authenticated attacker with the corresponding
access rights (such as "WebAdmin") that was impersonating the victim could insert
malicious JavaScript code in these notes that would be executed if the victim
visited the dashboard.

Affected products: Version 11.X: EPiServer.CMS.Core (<11.21.4) with EPiServer.CMS.UI (<11.37.5), Version 12.X: EPiServer.CMS.Core (<12.22.1) with EPiServer.CMS.UI (<11.37.3)

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Episerver Content Management System (CMS) by Optimizely was affected by multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This allowed an authenticated attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

Les objectifs sont pluriels : responsabiliser les fabricants, les importateurs et les distributeurs et renforcer la confiance des consommateurs.</p>
<p>L'ANSSI, en tant qu'autorité nationale en matière de cybersécurité et de cyberdéfense, est fortement impliquée dans la mise en application du CRA. Autorité nationale de certification de cybersécurité au titre du Cyber Security Act (CSA), l’ANSSI assurera également le rôle d’autorité notifiante au titre du CRA en charge d’évaluer, de contrôler et de notifier les organismes d’évaluation de la conformité (OEC) exerçant dans ce cadre.</p>
<p>En effet, le règlement 2024/2847 dit CRA requiert le recours à des organismes notifiés pour évaluer la conformité au règlement CRA notamment pour les produits importants de classe II et les produits critiques. L’ANSSI pourra notifier ces organismes d’évaluation de la conformité dès juin 2026.</p>
<p>Le règlement CRA énonce des exigences relatives à ces OEC et permet aux Etats membres de s’appuyer sur l’accréditation pour l’évaluation de ces exigences, et donc pour la France sur un programme élaboré par le COFRAC.</p>
<p>Dans ce contexte, l’ANSSI souhaite se rapprocher des OEC qui sont amenés à jouer ce rôle central afin de mettre en place le cadre national en lien avec l’écosystème concerné.</p>
<p><em><strong>Vous êtes centre de certification ou laboratoire d’évaluation et intéressé par le statut d’organisme notifié au titre du règlement CRA ? Nous vous invitons à nous contacter : <a href="mailto:cra@ssi.gouv.fr">cra@ssi.gouv.fr</a> afin de recevoir notre questionnaire.</strong></em></p>

      <title>CVE-2025-54365 - Fastapi-Guard Regular Expression ReDoS Bypass</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54365
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 4 days, 7 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>fastapi-guard is a security library for FastAPI that provides middleware to control IPs, log requests, detect penetration attempts and more. In version 3.0.1, the regular expression patched to mitigate the ReDoS vulnerability by limiting the length of string fails to catch inputs that exceed this limit. This type of patch fails to detect cases in which the string representing the attributes of a <script> tag exceeds 100 characters. As a result, most of the regex patterns present in version 3.0.1 can be bypassed. This is fixed in version 3.0.2.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2016-15044
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 4 days, 8 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Kaltura versions prior to 11.1.0-2 due to unsafe deserialization of user-controlled data within the keditorservices module. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this issue by sending a specially crafted serialized PHP object in the kdata GET parameter to the redirectWidgetCmd endpoint. Successful exploitation leads to execution of arbitrary PHP code in the context of the web server process.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32019
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 4 days, 9 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Harbor is an open source trusted cloud native registry project that stores, signs, and scans content.

      <title>CVE-2025-47281 - Kyverno JMESPath Variable Substitution Denial of Service</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47281
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 4 days, 9 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. In versions 1.14.1 and below, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists due to improper handling of JMESPath variable substitutions. Attackers with permissions to create or update Kyverno policies can craft expressions using the {{@}} variable combined with a pipe and an invalid JMESPath function (e.g., {{@ | non_existent_function }}). This leads to a nil value being substituted into the policy structure. Subsequent processing by internal functions, specifically getValueAsStringMap, which expect string values, results in a panic due to a type assertion failure (interface {} is nil, not string). This crashes Kyverno worker threads in the admission controller and causes continuous crashes of the reports controller pod. This is fixed in version 1.14.2.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53537
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 4 days, 9 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>LibHTP is a security-aware parser for the HTTP protocol and its related bits and pieces. In versions 0.5.50 and below, there is a traffic-induced memory leak that can starve the process of memory, leading to loss of visibility. To workaround this issue, set `suricata.yaml app-layer.protocols.http.libhtp.default-config.lzma-enabled` to false. This issue is fixed in version 0.5.51.

      <title>CVE-2025-53942 - Authentik OAuth/SAML Deactivated User Partial Access Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53942
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 4 days, 9 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>authentik is an open-source Identity Provider that emphasizes flexibility and versatility, with support for a wide set of protocols. In versions 2025.4.4 and earlier, as well as versions 2025.6.0-rc1 through 2025.6.3, deactivated users who registered through OAuth/SAML or linked their accounts to OAuth/SAML providers can still retain partial access to the system despite their accounts being deactivated. They end up in a half-authenticated state where they cannot access the API but crucially they can authorize applications if they know the URL of the application. To workaround this issue, developers can add an expression policy to the user login stage on the respective authentication flow with the expression of return request.context["pending_user"].is_active. This modification ensures that the return statement only activates the user login stage when the user is active. This issue is fixed in versions authentik 2025.4.4 and 2025.6.4.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54377
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 4 days, 9 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent that lives in users' editors. In versions 3.23.18 and below, RooCode does not validate line breaks (\n) in its command input, allowing potential bypass of the allow-list mechanism. The project appears to lack parsing or validation logic to prevent multi-line command injection. When commands are evaluated for execution, only the first line or token may be considered, enabling attackers to smuggle additional commands in subsequent lines. This is fixed in version 3.23.19.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-8058
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 4 days, 10 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The regcomp function in the GNU C library version from 2.4 to 2.41 is 
subject to a double free if some previous allocation fails. It can be 
accomplished either by a malloc failure or by using an interposed malloc
 that injects random malloc failures. The double free can allow buffer 
manipulation depending of how the regex is constructed. This issue 
affects all architectures and ABIs supported by the GNU C library.

<strong>Description : </strong>During the AWS Client VPN client installation on Windows devices, the install process references the C:\usr\local\windows-x86_64-openssl-localbuild\ssl directory location to fetch the OpenSSL configuration file. As a result, a non-admin user could place arbitrary code in the configuration file. If an admin user starts the AWS Client VPN client installation process, that code could be executed with root-level privileges. This issue does not affect Linux or Mac devices. 

We recommend users discontinue any new installations of AWS Client VPN on Windows prior to version 5.2.2.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6018
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 4 days, 15 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability has been discovered in pam-config within Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). This flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker (for example, a user logged in via SSH) to obtain the elevated privileges normally reserved for a physically present, "allow_active" user. The highest risk is that the attacker can then perform all allow_active yes Polkit actions, which are typically restricted to console users, potentially gaining unauthorized control over system configurations, services, or other sensitive operations.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unauthenticated OS command injection vulnerability exists within Xdebug versions 2.5.5 and earlier, a PHP debugging extension developed by Derick Rethans. When remote debugging is enabled, Xdebug listens on port 9000 and accepts debugger protocol commands without authentication.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in lastore-daemon, the system package manager daemon used in Deepin Linux (developed by Wuhan Deepin Technology Co., Ltd.). In versions 0.9.53-1 (Deepin 15.5) and 0.9.66-1 (Deepin 15.7), the D-Bus configuration permits any user in the sudo group to invoke the InstallPackage method without password authentication. By default, the first user created on Deepin is in the sudo group. An attacker with shell access can craft a .deb package containing a malicious post-install script and use dbus-send to install it via lastore-daemon, resulting in arbitrary code execution as root.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Marathon UI in DC/OS < 1.9.0 allows unauthenticated users to deploy arbitrary Docker containers. Due to improper restriction of volume mount configurations, attackers can deploy a container that mounts the host's root filesystem (/) with read/write privileges. When using a malicious Docker image, the attacker can write to /etc/cron.d/ on the host, achieving arbitrary code execution with root privileges. This impacts any system where the Docker daemon honors Marathon container configurations without policy enforcement.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-8070
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 14 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Windows service configuration of ABP and AES contains an unquoted ImagePath registry value vulnerability. This allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious executable in a predictable location such as C:\Program.exe. If the service runs with elevated privileges, exploitation results in privilege escalation to SYSTEM level. This vulnerability arises from an unquoted service path affecting systems where the executable resides in a path containing spaces.
Affected products and versions include: ABP 2.0.7.6130 and earlier as well as AES 1.0.6.6133 and earlier.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6190
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Realty Portal – Agent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization within the rp_user_profile() AJAX handler in versions 0.1.0 through 0.3.9. The handler reads the client-supplied meta key and value pairs from $_POST and passes them directly to update_user_meta() without restricting to a safe whitelist. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to overwrite the wp_capabilities meta and grant themselves the administrator role.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6214
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Omnishop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery on its /users/delete REST route in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. The route’s permission_callback only verifies that the requester is logged in, but fails to require any nonce or other proof of intent. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary user accounts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6215
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Omnishop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Registration Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. Its /users/register endpoint is exposed to the public (permission_callback always returns true) and invokes wp_create_user() unconditionally,  ignoring the site’s users_can_register option and any nonce or CAPTCHA checks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create arbitrary user accounts (customer) on sites where registrations should be closed.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>HAX CMS allows users to manage their microsite universe with a NodeJS or PHP backend. In haxcms-nodejs versions 11.0.12 and below and in haxcms-php versions 11.0.7 and below, all pages within the HAX CMS application do not contain headers to prevent other websites from loading the site within an iframe. This applies to both the CMS and generated sites. An unauthenticated attacker can load the standalone login page or other sensitive functionality within an iframe, performing a UI redressing attack (clickjacking). This can be used to perform social engineering attacks to attempt to coerce users into performing unintended actions within the HAX CMS application. This is fixed in haxcms-nodejs version 11.0.13 and haxcms-php 11.0.8.

      <title>CVE-2025-53538 - Suricata HTTP2 Data Stream 0 Memory Corruption Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53538
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 42 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. In versions 7.0.10 and below and  8.0.0-beta1 through 8.0.0-rc1, mishandling of data on HTTP2 stream 0 can lead to uncontrolled memory usage, leading to loss of visibility. Workarounds include disabling the HTTP/2 parser, and using a signature like drop http2 any any -> any any (frame:http2.hdr; byte_test:1,=,0,3; byte_test:4,=,0,5; sid: 1;) where the first byte test tests the HTTP2 frame type DATA and the second tests the stream id 0. This is fixed in versions 7.0.11 and 8.0.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-54072 - Yt-dlp Windows Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</title>

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 42 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>yt-dlp is a feature-rich command-line audio/video downloader. In versions 2025.06.25 and below, when the --exec option is used on Windows with the default placeholder (or {}), insufficient sanitization is applied to the expanded filepath, allowing for remote code execution. This is a bypass of the mitigation for CVE-2024-22423 where the default placeholder and {} were not covered by the new escaping rules. Windows users who are unable to upgrade should avoid using --exec altogether. Instead, the --write-info-json or --dump-json options could be used, with an external script or command line consuming the JSON output. This is fixed in version 2025.07.21.

      <title>CVE-2025-54137 - HAX CMS NodeJS Hardcoded Credentials and Private Keys Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54137
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 42 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>HAX CMS NodeJS allows users to manage their microsite universe with a NodeJS backend. Versions 11.0.9 and below were distributed with hardcoded default credentials for the user and superuser accounts. Additionally, the application has default private keys for JWTs. Users aren't prompted to change credentials or secrets during installation, and there is no way to change them through the UI. An unauthenticated attacker can read the default user credentials and JWT private keys from the public haxtheweb GitHub repositories. These credentials and keys can be used to access unconfigured self-hosted instances of the application, modify sites, and perform further attacks. This is fixed in version 11.0.10.

      <title>CVE-2025-54138 - LibreNMS Remote File Inclusion Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54138
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 42 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring which includes support for a wide range of network hardware and operating systems. LibreNMS versions 25.6.0 and below contain an architectural vulnerability in the ajax_form.php endpoint that permits Remote File Inclusion based on user-controlled POST input. The application directly uses the type parameter to dynamically include .inc.php files from the trusted path includes/html/forms/, without validation or allowlisting. This pattern introduces a latent Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector if an attacker can stage a file in this include path — for example, via symlink, development misconfiguration, or chained vulnerabilities. This is fixed in version 25.7.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-54140 - pyLoad Path Traversal Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54140
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 42 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>pyLoad is a free and open-source Download Manager written in pure Python. In version 0.5.0b3.dev89, an authenticated path traversal vulnerability exists in the /json/upload endpoint of pyLoad. By manipulating the filename of an uploaded file, an attacker can traverse out of the intended upload directory, allowing them to write arbitrary files to any location on the system accessible to the pyLoad process. This may lead to: Remote Code Execution (RCE), local privilege escalation, system-wide compromise, persistence, and backdoors. This is fixed in version 0.5.0b3.dev90.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34142
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability exists in ETQ Reliance on the CG (legacy) platform within the `/resources/sessions/sso` endpoint. The SAML authentication handler processes XML input without disabling external entity resolution, allowing crafted SAML responses to invoke external entity references. This could enable attackers to retrieve sensitive files or perform server-side request forgery (SSRF). The issue was addressed by disabling external entity processing for the affected XML parser in versions SE.2025.1 and 2025.1.2.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34143
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in ETQ Reliance on the CG (legacy) platform. The application allowed login as the privileged internal SYSTEM user by manipulating the username field. The SYSTEM account does not require a password, enabling attackers with network access to the login page to obtain elevated access. Once authenticated, an attacker could achieve remote code execution by modifying Jython scripts within the application. This issue was resolved by introducing stricter validation logic to exclude internal accounts from public authentication workflows in version MP-4583.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Birth Chart Compatibility plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to insufficient protection against directly accessing the plugin's index.php file, which causes an error exposing the full path. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The bSecure plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization within its order_info REST endpoint in versions 1.3.7 through 1.7.9. The plugin registers the /webhook/v2/order_info/ route with a permission_callback that always returns true, effectively bypassing all authentication. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers who know any user’s email to obtain a valid login cookie and fully impersonate that account.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7692
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Orion Login with SMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to the olws_handle_verify_phone() function not utilizing a strong enough OTP value, exposing the hash needed to generate the OTP value, and no restrictions on the number of attempts to submit the code. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users, including administrators, if they have access to their phone number.

      <title>CVE-2025-38352 - Linux Kernel POSIX CPU Timers Race Condition Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38352
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 7 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-cpu-timers: fix race between handle_posix_cpu_timers() and posix_cpu_timer_del()

If an exiting non-autoreaping task has already passed exit_notify() and
calls handle_posix_cpu_timers() from IRQ, it can be reaped by its parent
or debugger right after unlock_task_sighand().

If a concurrent posix_cpu_timer_del() runs at that moment, it won't be
able to detect timer->it.cpu.firing != 0: cpu_timer_task_rcu() and/or
lock_task_sighand() will fail.

Add the tsk->exit_state check into run_posix_cpu_timers() to fix this.

This fix is not needed if CONFIG_POSIX_CPU_TIMERS_TASK_WORK=y, because
exit_task_work() is called before exit_notify(). But the check still
makes sense, task_work_add(&tsk->posix_cputimers_work.work) will fail
anyway in this case.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7645
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 8 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Extensions For CF7 (Contact form 7 Database, Conditional Fields and Redirection) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'delete-file' field in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.8.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53832
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 21, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Lara Translate MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for Lara Translate API. Versions 0.0.11 and below contain a command injection vulnerability which exists in the @translated/lara-mcp MCP Server. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to child_process.exec, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces the possibility of shell metacharacter injection (|, >, &&, etc.). This vulnerability is fixed in version 0.0.12.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54127
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 21, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>HAXcms with nodejs backend allows users to start the server in any HAXsite or HAXcms instance. In versions 11.0.6 and below, the NodeJS version of HAXcms uses an insecure default configuration designed for local development. The default configuration does not perform authorization or authentication checks. If a user were to deploy haxcms-nodejs without modifying the default settings, ‘HAXCMS_DISABLE_JWT_CHECKS‘ would be set to ‘true‘ and their deployment would lack session authentication. This is fixed in version 11.0.7.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 21, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>HAX CMS NodeJs allows users to manage their microsite universe with a NodeJs backend. In versions 11.0.7 and below, the NodeJS version of HAX CMS has a disabled Content Security Policy (CSP). This configuration is insecure for a production application because it does not protect against cross-site-scripting attacks. The contentSecurityPolicy value is explicitly disabled in the application's Helmet configuration in app.js. This is fixed in version 11.0.8.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 21, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>HAXiam is a packaging wrapper for HAXcms which allows anyone to spawn their own microsite management platform. In versions 11.0.4 and below, the application returns a 200 response when requesting the data of a valid user and a 404 response when requesting the data of an invalid user. This can be used to infer the existence of valid user accounts. An authenticated attacker can use automated tooling to brute force potential usernames and use the application's response to identify valid accounts. This can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, such as the lack of authorization checks, to enumerate and deface another user's sites. This is fixed in version 11.0.5.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 21, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>HAX CMS NodeJs allows users to manage their microsite universe with a NodeJs backend. In versions 11.0.8 and below, the HAX CMS NodeJS application crashes when an authenticated attacker provides an API request lacking required URL parameters. This vulnerability affects the listFiles and saveFiles endpoints. This vulnerability exists because the application does not properly handle exceptions which occur as a result of changes to user-modifiable URL parameters. This is fixed in version 11.0.9.

      <title>CVE-2025-47917 - Mbed TLS Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47917
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 20, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Mbed TLS before 3.6.4 allows a use-after-free in certain situations of applications that are developed in accordance with the documentation. The function mbedtls_x509_string_to_names() takes a head argument that is documented as an output argument. The documentation does not suggest that the function will free that pointer; however, the function does call mbedtls_asn1_free_named_data_list() on that argument, which performs a deep free(). As a result, application code that uses this function (relying only on documented behavior) is likely to still hold pointers to the memory blocks that were freed, resulting in a high risk of use-after-free or double-free. In particular, the two sample programs x509/cert_write and x509/cert_req are affected (use-after-free if the san string contains more than one DN).

      <title>CVE-2025-38351 - KVM Hyper-V Canonical GVA Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38351
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 19, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 12 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86/hyper-v: Skip non-canonical addresses during PV TLB flush

In KVM guests with Hyper-V hypercalls enabled, the hypercalls
HVCALL_FLUSH_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS_LIST and HVCALL_FLUSH_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS_LIST_EX
allow a guest to request invalidation of portions of a virtual TLB.
For this, the hypercall parameter includes a list of GVAs that are supposed
to be invalidated.

However, when non-canonical GVAs are passed, there is currently no
filtering in place and they are eventually passed to checked invocations of
INVVPID on Intel / INVLPGA on AMD.  While AMD's INVLPGA silently ignores
non-canonical addresses (effectively a no-op), Intel's INVVPID explicitly
signals VM-Fail and ultimately triggers the WARN_ONCE in invvpid_error():

  invvpid failed: ext=0x0 vpid=1 gva=0xaaaaaaaaaaaaa000
  WARNING: CPU: 6 PID: 326 at arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c:482
  invvpid_error+0x91/0xa0 [kvm_intel]
  Modules linked in: kvm_intel kvm 9pnet_virtio irqbypass fuse
  CPU: 6 UID: 0 PID: 326 Comm: kvm-vm Not tainted 6.15.0 #14 PREEMPT(voluntary)
  RIP: 0010:invvpid_error+0x91/0xa0 [kvm_intel]
  Call Trace:
    vmx_flush_tlb_gva+0x320/0x490 [kvm_intel]
    kvm_hv_vcpu_flush_tlb+0x24f/0x4f0 [kvm]
    kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x3013/0x5810 [kvm]

Hyper-V documents that invalid GVAs (those that are beyond a partition's
GVA space) are to be ignored.  While not completely clear whether this
ruling also applies to non-canonical GVAs, it is likely fine to make that
assumption, and manual testing on Azure confirms "real" Hyper-V interprets
the specification in the same way.

Skip non-canonical GVAs when processing the list of address to avoid
tripping the INVVPID failure.  Alternatively, KVM could filter out "bad"
GVAs before inserting into the FIFO, but practically speaking the only
downside of pushing validation to the final processing is that doing so
is suboptimal for the guest, and no well-behaved guest will request TLB
flushes for non-canonical addresses.

<strong>Description : </strong>The Subscribe to Comments for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in versions up to, and including, 2.1.2 via the Path to header value. This allows authenticated attackers, with administrative privileges and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included. This same function can also be used to execute arbitrary PHP code.

      <title>CVE-2025-6997 - "ThemeREX Addons WordPress Stored Cross-Site Scripting"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6997
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 19, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 7 hours, 51 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The ThemeREX Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 2.35.1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The plugin’s SVG rendering routine calls the trx_addons_get_svg_from_file() function on an unvalidated 'svg' parameter supplied via the shortcode or Elementor widget settings, then outputs it via the trx_addons_show_layout() function.  Because there is no check on the URL’s origin, scheme, or the SVG content itself, authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, can supply a remote SVG and inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.

      <title>CVE-2025-38350 - Linux Kernel HFSC Netem Blackhole Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38350
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 19, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 51 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: Always pass notifications when child class becomes empty

Certain classful qdiscs may invoke their classes' dequeue handler on an
enqueue operation. This may unexpectedly empty the child qdisc and thus
make an in-flight class passive via qlen_notify(). Most qdiscs do not
expect such behaviour at this point in time and may re-activate the
class eventually anyways which will lead to a use-after-free.

The referenced fix commit attempted to fix this behavior for the HFSC
case by moving the backlog accounting around, though this turned out to
be incomplete since the parent's parent may run into the issue too.
The following reproducer demonstrates this use-after-free:

    tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: drr
    tc filter add dev lo parent 1: basic classid 1:1
    tc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 drr
    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2: hfsc def 1
    tc class add dev lo parent 2: classid 2:1 hfsc rt m1 8 d 1 m2 0
    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 2:1 handle 3: netem
    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 3:1 handle 4: blackhole

    echo 1 | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888
    tc class delete dev lo classid 1:1
    echo 1 | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888

Since backlog accounting issues leading to a use-after-frees on stale
class pointers is a recurring pattern at this point, this patch takes
a different approach. Instead of trying to fix the accounting, the patch
ensures that qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog always calls qlen_notify when
the child qdisc is empty. This solves the problem because deletion of
qdiscs always involves a call to qdisc_reset() and / or
qdisc_purge_queue() which ultimately resets its qlen to 0 thus causing
the following qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() to report to the parent. Note
that this may call qlen_notify on passive classes multiple times. This
is not a problem after the recent patch series that made all the
classful qdiscs qlen_notify() handlers idempotent.

      <title>CVE-2025-7394 - OpenSSL wolfSSL Predictable Random Number Generation After Fork Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7394
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 18, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the OpenSSL compatibility layer implementation, the function RAND_poll() was not behaving as expected and leading to the potential for predictable values returned from RAND_bytes() after fork() is called. This can lead to weak or predictable random numbers generated in applications that are both using RAND_bytes() and doing fork() operations. This only affects applications explicitly calling RAND_bytes() after fork() and does not affect any internal TLS operations. Although RAND_bytes() documentation in OpenSSL calls out not being safe for use with fork() without first calling RAND_poll(), an additional code change was also made in wolfSSL to make RAND_bytes() behave similar to OpenSSL after a fork() call without calling RAND_poll(). Now the Hash-DRBG used gets reseeded after detecting running in a new process. If making use of RAND_bytes() and calling fork() we recommend updating to the latest version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Per Allansson from Appgate for the report.

<strong>Description : </strong>Wasmtime is a runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to versions 24.0.4, 33.0.2, and 34.0.2, a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of the WASIp1 set of import functions can lead to a WebAssembly guest inducing a panic in the host (embedder). The specific bug is triggered by calling `path_open` after calling `fd_renumber` with either two equal argument values or a second argument being equal to a previously-closed file descriptor number value. The corrupt state introduced in `fd_renumber` will lead to the subsequent opening of a file descriptor to panic. This panic cannot introduce memory unsafety or allow WebAssembly to break outside of its sandbox, however. There is no possible heap corruption or memory unsafety from this panic. This bug is in the implementation of Wasmtime's `wasmtime-wasi` crate which provides an implementation of WASIp1. The bug requires a specially crafted call to `fd_renumber` in addition to the ability to open a subsequent file descriptor. Opening a second file descriptor is only possible when a preopened directory was provided to the guest, and this is common amongst embeddings. A panic in the host is considered a denial-of-service vector for WebAssembly embedders and is thus a security issue in Wasmtime. This bug does not affect WASIp2 and embedders using components. In accordance with Wasmtime's release process, patch releases are available as 24.0.4, 33.0.2, and 34.0.2. Users of other release of Wasmtime are recommended to move to a supported release of Wasmtime. Embedders who are using components or are not providing guest access to create more file descriptors (e.g. via a preopened filesystem directory) are not affected by this issue. Otherwise, there is no workaround at this time, and affected embeddings are recommended to update to a patched version which will not cause a panic in the host.

      <title>CVE-2025-53888 - RIOT-OS L2FILTER Add Buffer Overflow</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53888
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 18, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>RIOT-OS, an operating system that supports Internet of Things devices, has an ineffective size check implemented with `assert()` can lead to buffer overflow in versions up to and including 2025.04. Assertions are usually compiled out in production builds. If assertions are the only defense against untrusted inputs, the software may be exposed to attacks that utilize the lack of proper input checks. In the `l2filter_add()` function shown below, `addr_len` is checked using an assertion and is subsequently used as an argument in a `memcpy()` call. When assertions are disabled, there would be no size check for `addr_len`. As a consequence, if an attacker were to provide an `addr_len` value larger than `CONFIG_L2FILTER_ADDR_MAXLEN`, they can trigger a buffer overflow and write past the `list[i].addr` buffer. If the unchecked input is attacker-controlled, the impact of the buffer overflow can range from a denial of service to arbitrary code execution. Commit f6f7de4ccc107c018630e4c15500825caf02e1c2 contains a patch for the vulnerability.

      <title>CVE-2025-54073 - Microsoft MCP Package Docs Command Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54073
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 18, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>mcp-package-docs is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides LLMs with efficient access to package documentation across multiple programming languages and language server protocol (LSP) capabilities. A command injection vulnerability exists in the `mcp-package-docs` MCP Server prior to the fix in commit cb4ad49615275379fd6f2f1cf1ec4731eec56eb9. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to `child_process.exec`, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces the possibility of shell metacharacter injection (`|`, `>`, `&&`, etc.). Commit cb4ad49615275379fd6f2f1cf1ec4731eec56eb9 in version 0.1.27 contains a fix for the issue, but upgrading to 0.1.28 is recommended.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>MDC is a tool to take regular Markdown and write documents interacting deeply with a Vue component. Prior to version 0.17.2, a remote script-inclusion / stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in @nuxtjs/mdc lets a Markdown author inject a `<base href="https://attacker.tld">` element. The `<base>` tag rewrites how all subsequent relative URLs are resolved, so an attacker can make the page load scripts, styles, or images from an external, attacker-controlled origin and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the site’s context. Version 0.17.2 contains a fix for the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-38349 - Linux Kernel Epoll Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38349
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 18, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 7 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eventpoll: don't decrement ep refcount while still holding the ep mutex

Jann Horn points out that epoll is decrementing the ep refcount and then
doing a

    mutex_unlock(&ep->mtx);

afterwards. That's very wrong, because it can lead to a use-after-free.

That pattern is actually fine for the very last reference, because the
code in question will delay the actual call to "ep_free(ep)" until after
it has unlocked the mutex.

But it's wrong for the much subtler "next to last" case when somebody
*else* may also be dropping their reference and free the ep while we're
still using the mutex.

Note that this is true even if that other user is also using the same ep
mutex: mutexes, unlike spinlocks, can not be used for object ownership,
even if they guarantee mutual exclusion.

A mutex "unlock" operation is not atomic, and as one user is still
accessing the mutex as part of unlocking it, another user can come in
and get the now released mutex and free the data structure while the
first user is still cleaning up.

See our mutex documentation in Documentation/locking/mutex-design.rst,
in particular the section [1] about semantics:

	"mutex_unlock() may access the mutex structure even after it has
	 internally released the lock already - so it's not safe for
	 another context to acquire the mutex and assume that the
	 mutex_unlock() context is not using the structure anymore"

So if we drop our ep ref before the mutex unlock, but we weren't the
last one, we may then unlock the mutex, another user comes in, drops
_their_ reference and releases the 'ep' as it now has no users - all
while the mutex_unlock() is still accessing it.

Fix this by simply moving the ep refcount dropping to outside the mutex:
the refcount itself is atomic, and doesn't need mutex protection (that's
the whole _point_ of refcounts: unlike mutexes, they are inherently
about object lifetimes).

      <title>CVE-2025-54068 - Livewire Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54068
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 17, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Livewire is a full-stack framework for Laravel. In Livewire v3 up to and including v3.6.3, a vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote command execution in specific scenarios. The issue stems from how certain component property updates are hydrated. This vulnerability is unique to Livewire v3 and does not affect prior major versions. Exploitation requires a component to be mounted and configured in a particular way, but does not require authentication or user interaction. This issue has been patched in Livewire v3.6.4. All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to this version or later as soon as possible. No known workarounds are available.

      <title>CVE-2025-54070 - OpenZeppelin Contracts Memory Access Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54070
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 17, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Starting in version 5.2.0 and prior to version 5.4.0, the `lastIndexOf(bytes,byte,uint256)` function of the `Bytes.sol` library may access uninitialized memory when the following two conditions hold: 1) the provided buffer length is empty (i.e. `buffer.length == 0`) and position is not `2**256 - 1` (i.e. `pos != type(uint256).max`). The `pos` argument could be used to access arbitrary data outside of the buffer bounds. This could lead to the operation running out of gas, or returning an invalid index (outside of the empty buffer). Processing this invalid result for accessing the `buffer` would cause a revert under normal conditions. When triggered, the function reads memory at offset `buffer + 0x20 + pos`. If memory at that location (outside the `buffer`) matches the search pattern, the function would return an out of bound index instead of the expected `type(uint256).max`. This creates unexpected behavior where callers receive a valid-looking index pointing outside buffer bounds. Subsequent memory accesses that don't check bounds and use the returned index must carefully review the potential impact depending on their setup. Code relying on this function returning `type(uint256).max` for empty buffers or using the returned index without bounds checking could exhibit undefined behavior. Users should upgrade to version 5.4.0 to receive a patch.

      <title>CVE-2025-53638 - Solady Silent Failure in Proxy Initialization Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53638
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 17, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Solady is software that provides Solidity snippets with APIs. Starting in version 0.0.125 and prior to version 0.1.24, when an account is deployed via a proxy, using regular Solidity to call its initialization function may result in a silent failure, if the initialization function does not return a `bool` or some other return data.  This is because regular Solidity uses `extcodesize(proxy)` to decide if call succeeds. This is insufficient in the case when the proxy points to an empty implementation. Users should upgrade to Solady v0.1.24 or later to receive a patch. Deploy any affected implementations and their factories on new EVM chains as soon as possible.

      <title>CVE-2025-7339 - "On-Headers Header Modification Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7339
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 17, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>on-headers is a node.js middleware for listening to when a response writes headers. A bug in on-headers versions `<1.1.0` may result in response headers being inadvertently modified when an array is passed to `response.writeHead()`. Users should upgrade to version 1.1.0 to receive a patch. Uses are strongly encouraged to upgrade to `1.1.0`, but this issue can be worked around by passing an object to `response.writeHead()` rather than an array.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54066
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 17, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>DiracX-Web is a web application that provides an interface to interact with the DiracX services. Prior to version 0.1.0-a8, an attacker can forge a request that they can pass to redirect an authenticated user to another arbitrary website. In the login page, DiracX-Web has a `redirect` field which is the location where the server will redirect the user. This URI is not verified, and can be an arbitrary URI. Paired with a parameter pollution, an attacker can hide their malicious URI. This could be used for phishing, and extract new data (such as redirecting to a new "log in" page, and asking another time credentials). Version 0.1.0-a8 fixes this vulnerability.

      <title>CVE-2025-54064 - Rucio Apache Access Log Credentials Exposure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54064
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 17, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 36 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Rucio is a software framework that provides functionality to organize, manage, and access large volumes of scientific data using customizable policies. The common Rucio helm-charts for the `rucio-server`, `rucio-ui`, and `rucio-webui` define the log format for the apache access log of these components. The `X-Rucio-Auth-Token`, which is part of each request header sent to Rucio, is part of this log format. Thus, each access log line potentially exposes the credentials (Internal Rucio token, or JWT in case of OIDC authentication) of the user. Due to the length of the token (Especially for a JWT) the tokens are often truncated, and thus not usable as credential; nevertheless, the (partial) credential should not be part of the logfile. The impact of this issue is amplified if the access logs are made available to a larger group of people than the instance administrators themselves. An updated release has been supplied for the `rucio-server`, `rucio-ui` and `rucio-webui` helm-chart. The change was also retrofitted for the currently supported Rucio LTS releases. The patched versions are rucio-server 37.0.2, 35.0.1, and 32.0.1; rucio-ui 37.0.4, 35.0.1, and 32.0.2; and rucio-webui 37.0.2, 35.1.1, and 32.0.1. As a workaround, one may update the `logFormat` variable and remove the `X-Rucio-Auth-Token`.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Catalyst::Plugin::Session before version 0.44 for Perl generates session ids insecurely.

The session id is generated from a (usually SHA-1) hash of a simple counter, the epoch time, the built-in rand function, the PID and the current Catalyst context. This information is of low entropy. The PID will come from a small set of numbers, and the epoch time may be guessed, if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.

Predicable session ids could allow an attacker to gain access to systems.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>MaxKB is an open-source AI assistant for enterprise. Prior to version 2.0.0, the sandbox design rules can be bypassed because MaxKB only restricts the execution permissions of files in a specific directory. Therefore, an attacker can use the `shutil.copy2` method in Python to copy the command they want to execute to the executable directory. This bypasses directory restrictions and reverse shell. Version 2.0.0 fixes the issue.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-5396
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 17, 2025, 2:15 a.m. | 12 hours, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Bears Backup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-5994
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 16, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 38 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A multi-vendor cache poisoning vulnerability named 'Rebirthday Attack' has been discovered in caching resolvers that support EDNS Client Subnet (ECS). Unbound is also vulnerable when compiled with ECS support, i.e., '--enable-subnet', AND configured to send ECS information along with queries to upstream name servers, i.e., at least one of the 'send-client-subnet', 'client-subnet-zone' or 'client-subnet-always-forward' options is used. Resolvers supporting ECS need to segregate outgoing queries to accommodate for different outgoing ECS information. This re-opens up resolvers to a birthday paradox attack (Rebirthday Attack) that tries to match the DNS transaction ID in order to cache non-ECS poisonous replies.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32874
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 16, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 32 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An issue was discovered in Kaseya Rapid Fire Tools Network Detective through 2.0.16.0. A vulnerability exists in the EncryptionUtil class because symmetric encryption is implemented in a deterministic and non-randomized fashion. The method Encrypt(byte[] clearData) derives both the encryption key and the IV from a fixed, hardcoded input by using a static salt value. As a result, identical plaintext inputs always produce identical ciphertext outputs. This is true for both FIPS and non-FIPS generated passwords. In other words, there is a cryptographic implementation flaw in the password encryption mechanism. Although there are multiple encryption methods grouped under FIPS and non-FIPS classifications, the logic consistently results in predictable and reversible encrypted outputs due to the lack of per-operation randomness and encryption authentication.

      <title>CVE-2025-53840 - Icinga DB Web Information Disclosure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53840
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 16, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 32 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Icinga DB Web provides a graphical interface for Icinga monitoring. Starting in version 1.2.0 and prior to version 1.2.2, users with access to Icinga Dependency Views, are allowed to see hosts and services that they weren't meant to on the dependency map. However, the name of an object will not be revealed nor does this grant access to a host's or service's detail view. Please note that this only affects the restrictions `filter/hosts` and `filter/services`. `filter/objects` is not affected by this and restricts objects as it is supposed to. Version 1.2.2 applies these restrictions properly. As a workaround, one may downgrade to version 1.1.3.

      <title>CVE-2025-53892 - Vue I18n DOM-based XSS Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53892
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 16, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 32 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Vue I18n is the internationalization plugin for Vue.js. The escapeParameterHtml: true option in Vue I18n is designed to protect against HTML/script injection by escaping interpolated parameters. However, starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to versions 9.14.5, 10.0.8, and 11.1.0, this setting fails to prevent execution of certain tag-based payloads, such as <img src=x onerror=...>, if the interpolated value is inserted inside an HTML context using v-html. This may lead to a DOM-based XSS vulnerability, even when using escapeParameterHtml: true, if a translation string includes minor HTML and is rendered via v-html. Versions 9.14.5, 10.0.8, and 11.1.0 contain a fix for the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-40918 - Apache::Authen::SASL::Perl DIGEST_MD5 CNonce Weak Randomness Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-40918
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 16, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 32 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Authen::SASL::Perl::DIGEST_MD5 versions 2.04 through 2.1800 for Perl generates the cnonce insecurely.

The cnonce (client nonce) is generated from an MD5 hash of the PID, the epoch time and the built-in rand function. The PID will come from a small set of numbers, and the epoch time may be guessed, if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.

According to RFC 2831, "The cnonce-value is an opaque quoted string value provided by the client and used by both client and server to avoid chosen plaintext attacks, and to provide mutual authentication. The security of the implementation depends on a good choice. It is RECOMMENDED that it contain at least 64 bits of entropy."

<strong>Published : </strong> July 16, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 31 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Ultimate WP Mail plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to improper authorization within the get_email_log_details() AJAX handler in versions 1.0.17 to 1.3.6. The handler reads the client-supplied post_id and retrieves the corresponding email log post content (including the password-reset link), relying only on the ‘edit_posts’ capability without restricting to administrators or validating ownership. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to harvest an admin’s reset link and elevate their privileges to administrator.

      <title>CVE-2025-7699 - ADM EZ Sync Manager Unauthenticated File Access Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7699
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 16, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 31 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An improper access control vulnerability  was found in the EZ Sync Manager of ADM, which allows authenticated users to copy arbitrary files from the server file system into their own EZSync folder. The vulnerability is due to a lack of authorization checks on the file parameter of the HTTP request. Attackers can exploit this flaw to access files outside their authorized scope, provided the file has readable permissions for other users on the underlying OS. This can lead to unauthorized exposure of sensitive data.
Affected products and versions include: from ADM 4.1.0 to ADM 4.3.3.RH61 as well as ADM 5.0.0.RIN1 and earlier.

      <title>CVE-2025-27465 - Xen Hypercall Instruction Replay Vulnerability (Arithmetic Flag Handling)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-27465
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 16, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Certain instructions need intercepting and emulating by Xen.  In some
cases Xen emulates the instruction by replaying it, using an executable
stub.  Some instructions may raise an exception, which is supposed to be
handled gracefully.  Certain replayed instructions have additional logic
to set up and recover the changes to the arithmetic flags.

For replayed instructions where the flags recovery logic is used, the
metadata for exception handling was incorrect, preventing Xen from
handling the the exception gracefully, treating it as fatal instead.

      <title>CVE-2025-53906 - Vim Zip File Path Traversal Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53906
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 13 hours, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Prior to version 9.1.1551, a path traversal issue in Vim’s zip.vim plugin can allow overwriting of arbitrary files when opening specially crafted zip archives. Impact is low because this exploit requires direct user interaction. However, successfully exploitation can lead to overwriting sensitive files or placing executable code in privileged locations, depending on the permissions of the process editing the archive. The victim must edit such a file using Vim which will reveal the filename and the file content, a careful user may suspect some strange things going on. Successful exploitation could results in the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. Version 9.1.1551 contains a patch for the vulnerability.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53893
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename, and edit files. In version 2.38.0, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the file processing logic when reading a file on endpoint  `Filebrowser-Server-IP:PORT/files/{file-name}` . While the server correctly handles and stores uploaded files, it attempts to load the entire content into memory during read operations without size checks or resource limits. This allows an authenticated user to upload a large file and trigger uncontrolled memory consumption on read, potentially crashing the server and making it unresponsive. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.

      <title>CVE-2025-53895 - ZITADEL Session Hijacking Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53895
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ZITADEL is an open source identity management system. Starting in version 2.53.0 and prior to versions 4.0.0-rc.2, 3.3.2, 2.71.13, and 2.70.14, vulnerability in ZITADEL's session management API allows any authenticated user to update a session if they know its ID, due to a missing permission check. This flaw enables session hijacking, allowing an attacker to impersonate another user and access sensitive resources. Versions prior to `2.53.0` are not affected, as they required the session token for updates. Versions 4.0.0-rc.2, 3.3.2, 2.71.13, and 2.70.14 fix the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-48795 - Apache CXF Unencrypted Temporary File Log Exposure Denial of Service</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48795
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Apache CXF stores large stream based messages as temporary files on the local filesystem. A bug was introduced which means that the entire temporary file is read into memory and then logged. An attacker might be able to exploit this to cause a denial of service attack by causing an out of memory exception. In addition, it is possible to configure CXF to encrypt temporary files to prevent sensitive credentials from being cached unencrypted on the local filesystem, however this bug means that the cached files are written out to logs unencrypted.

Users are recommended to upgrade to versions 3.5.11, 3.6.6, 4.0.7 or 4.1.1, which fixes this issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-53621 - DSpace XXE Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53621
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. Two related XML External Entity (XXE) injection possibilities impact all versions of DSpace prior to 7.6.4, 8.2, and 9.1. External entities are not disabled when parsing XML files during import of an archive (in Simple Archive Format), either from command-line (`./dspace import` command) or from the "Batch Import (Zip)" user interface feature. External entities are also not explicitly disabled when parsing XML responses from some upstream services (ArXiv, Crossref, OpenAIRE, Creative Commons) used in import from external sources via the user interface or REST API. An XXE injection in these files may result in a connection being made to an attacker's site or a local path readable by the Tomcat user, with content potentially being injected into a metadata field. In the latter case, this may result in sensitive content disclosure, including retrieving arbitrary files or configurations from the server where DSpace is running. The Simple Archive Format (SAF) importer / Batch Import (Zip) is only usable by site administrators (from user interface / REST API) or system administrators (from command-line). Therefore, to exploit this vulnerability, the malicious payload would have to be provided by an attacker and trusted by an administrator, who would trigger the import. The fix is included in DSpace 7.6.4, 8.2, and 9.1. Please upgrade to one of these versions. For those who cannot upgrade immediately, it is possible to manually patch the DSpace backend. One may also apply some best practices, though the protection provided is not as complete as upgrading. Administrators must carefully inspect any SAF archives (they did not construct themselves) before importing. As necessary, affected external services can be disabled to mitigate the ability for payloads to be delivered via external service APIs.

      <title>CVE-2025-53622 - DSpace Tomcat Path Traversal Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53622
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. Prior to versions 7.6.4, 8.2, and 9.1, a path traversal vulnerability is possible during the import of an archive (in Simple Archive Format), either from command-line (`./dspace import` command) or from the "Batch Import (Zip)" user interface feature. An attacker may craft a malicious Simple Archive Format (SAF) package where the `contents` file references any system files (using relative traversal sequences) which are readable by the Tomcat user.  If such a package is imported, this will result in sensitive content disclose, including retrieving arbitrary files or configurations from the server where DSpace is running. The Simple Archive Format (SAF) importer / Batch Import (Zip) is only usable by site administrators (from user interface / REST API) or system administrators (from command-line). Therefore, to exploit this vulnerability, the malicious payload would have to be provided by an attacker and trusted by an administrator (who would trigger the import). The fix is included in DSpace 7.6.4, 8.2 and 9.1. For those who cannot upgrade immediately, it is possible to manually patch the DSpace backend. (No changes are necessary to the frontend.)  A pull request exists which can be used to patch systems running DSpace 7.6.x, 8.x or 9.0. Although it is not possible to fully protect the system via workarounds, one may can apply a best practice. Administrators must carefully inspect any SAF archives (they did not construct themselves) before importing, paying close attention to the `contents` file to validate it does not reference files outside of the SAF archives.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53836
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 12 hours, 29 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>XWiki Rendering is a generic rendering system that converts textual input in a given syntax (wiki syntax, HTML, etc) into another syntax (XHTML, etc). Starting in version 4.2-milestone-1 and prior to versions 13.10.11, 14.4.7, and 14.10, the default macro content parser doesn't preserve the restricted attribute of the transformation context when executing nested macros. This allows executing macros that are normally forbidden in restricted mode, in particular script macros. The cache and chart macros that are bundled in XWiki use the vulnerable feature. This has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.7 and 14.10. To avoid the exploitation of this bug, comments can be disabled for untrusted users until an upgrade to a patched version has been performed. Note that users with edit rights will still be able to add comments via the object editor even if comments have been disabled.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 12 hours, 29 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.12.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, Directus Flows with a manual trigger are not validating whether the user triggering the Flow has permissions to the items provided as payload to the Flow. Depending on what the Flow is set up to do this can lead to the Flow executing potential tasks on the attacker's behalf without authenticating. Bad actors could execute the manual trigger Flows without authentication, or access rights to the said collection(s) or item(s). Users with manual trigger Flows configured are impacted as these endpoints do not currently validate if the user has read access to `directus_flows` or to the relevant collection/items. The manual trigger Flows should have tighter security requirements as compared to webhook Flows where users are expected to perform do their own checks. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue. As a workaround, implement permission checks for read access to Flows and read access to relevant collection/items.

Prior to version 0.24.3, an unauthenticated preview deployment vulnerability in Dokploy allows any user to execute arbitrary code and access sensitive environment variables by simply opening a pull request on a public repository. This exposes secrets and potentially enables remote code execution, putting all public Dokploy users using these preview deployments at risk. Version 0.24.3 contains a fix for the issue.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53835
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 14, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 13 hours, 29 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>XWiki Rendering is a generic rendering system that converts textual input in a given syntax (wiki syntax, HTML, etc) into another syntax (XHTML, etc). Starting in version 5.4.5 and prior to version 14.10, the XHTML syntax depended on the `xdom+xml/current` syntax which allows the creation of raw blocks that permit the insertion of arbitrary HTML content including JavaScript. This allows XSS attacks for users who can edit a document like their user profile (enabled by default). This has been fixed in version 14.10 by removing the dependency on the `xdom+xml/current` syntax from the XHTML syntax. Note that the `xdom+xml` syntax is still vulnerable to this attack. As it's main purpose is testing and its use is quite difficult, this syntax shouldn't be installed or used on a regular wiki. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53640
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 14, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 8 hours, 9 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Indico is an event management system that uses Flask-Multipass, a multi-backend authentication system for Flask. Starting in version 2.2 and prior to version 3.3.7, an endpoint used to display details of users listed in certain fields (such as ACLs) could be misused to dump basic user details (such as name, affiliation and email) in bulk. Version 3.3.7 fixes the issue. Owners of instances that allow everyone to create a user account, who wish to truly restrict access to these user details, should consider restricting user search to managers. As a workaround, it is possible to restrict access to the affected endpoints (e.g. in the webserver config), but doing so would break certain form fields which could no longer show the details of the users listed in those fields, so upgrading instead is highly recommended.

      <title>CVE-2025-27582 - One Identity Password Manager Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-27582
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 14, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 27 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Secure Password extension in One Identity Password Manager before 5.14.4 allows local privilege escalation. The issue arises from a flawed security hardening mechanism within the kiosk browser used to display the Password Self-Service site to end users. Specifically, the application attempts to restrict privileged actions by overriding the native window.print() function. However, this protection can be bypassed by an attacker who accesses the Password Self-Service site from the lock screen and navigates to an attacker-controlled webpage via the Help function. By hosting a crafted web page with JavaScript, the attacker can restore and invoke the window.print() function, launching a SYSTEM-privileged print dialog. From this dialog, the attacker can exploit standard Windows functionality - such as the Print to PDF or Add Printer wizard - to spawn a command prompt with SYSTEM privileges. Successful exploitation allows a local attacker (with access to a locked workstation) to gain SYSTEM-level privileges, granting full control over the affected device.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-1313
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 12, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 10 hours, 13 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Nokri - Job Board WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.3.

      <title>CVE-2025-24294 - Apache Resolv DNS Denial of Service Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-24294
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 12, 2025, 4:15 a.m. | 10 hours, 13 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The attack vector is a potential Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient check on the length of a decompressed domain name within a DNS packet.

An attacker can craft a malicious DNS packet containing a highly compressed domain name. When the resolv library parses such a packet, the name decompression process consumes a large amount of CPU resources, as the library does not limit the resulting length of the name.

This resource consumption can cause the application thread to become unresponsive, resulting in a Denial of Service condition.

      <title>CVE-2024-47065 - Meshtastic Traceroute Rate Limiting Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-47065
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 11, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 13 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Meshtastic is an open source mesh networking solution. Prior to 2.5.1, traceroute responses from the remote node are not rate limited. Given that there are SNR measurements attributed to each received transmission, this is a guaranteed way to get a remote station to reliably and continuously respond. You could easily get 100 samples in a short amount of time (estimated 2 minutes), whereas passively doing the same could take hours or days. There are secondary effects that non-ratelimited traceroute does also allow a 2:1 reflected DoS of the network as well, but these concerns are less than the problem with positional confidentiality (other DoS routes exist). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-43856 - Immich OAuth2 CSRF Account Hijacking Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-43856
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 11, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 13 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>immich is a high performance self-hosted photo and video management solution. Prior to 1.132.0, immich is vulnerable to account hijacking through oauth2, because the state parameter is not being checked. The oauth2 state parameter is similar to a csrf token, so when the user starts the login flow this unpredictable token is generated and somehow saved in the browser session and passed to the identity provider, which will return the state parameter when redirecting the user back to immich. Before the user is logged in that parameter needs to be verified to make sure the login was actively initiated by the user in this browser session. On it's own, this wouldn't be too bad, but when immich uses the /user-settings page as a redirect_uri, it will automatically link the accounts if the user was already logged in. This means that if someone has an immich instance with a public oauth provider (like google), an attacker can - for example - embed a hidden iframe in a webpage or even just send the victim a forged oauth login url with a code that logs the victim into the attackers oauth account and redirects back to immich and links the accounts. After this, the attacker can log into the victims account using their own oauth credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.132.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-45582 - Apache GNU Tar Directory Traversal Overwrite Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-45582
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 11, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 13 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>GNU Tar through 1.35 allows file overwrite via directory traversal in crafted TAR archives, with a certain two-step process. First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of "Member name contains '..'" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain "x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which "tar xf" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages).

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7027
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 11, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in the Software SMI handler (SwSmiInputValue 0xB2) allows a local attacker to control both the read and write addresses used by the CommandRcx1 function. The write target is derived from an unvalidated UEFI NVRAM variable (SetupXtuBufferAddress), while the write content is read from an attacker-controlled pointer based on the RBX register. This dual-pointer dereference enables arbitrary memory writes within System Management RAM (SMRAM), leading to potential SMM privilege escalation and firmware compromise.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7028
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 11, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in the Software SMI handler (SwSmiInputValue 0x20) allows a local attacker to supply a crafted pointer (FuncBlock) through RBX and RCX register values. This pointer is passed unchecked into multiple flash management functions (ReadFlash, WriteFlash, EraseFlash, and GetFlashInfo) that dereference both the structure and its nested members, such as BufAddr. This enables arbitrary read/write access to System Management RAM (SMRAM), allowing an attacker to corrupt firmware memory, exfiltrate SMRAM content via flash, or install persistent implants.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-52985
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 11, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A Use of Incorrect Operator

vulnerability in the Routing Engine firewall of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to bypass security restrictions.

When a firewall filter which is applied to the lo0 or re:mgmt interface references a prefix list with 'from prefix-list', and that prefix list contains more than 10 entries, the prefix list doesn't match and packets destined to or from the local device are not filtered.


This issue affects firewall filters applied to the re:mgmt interfaces as input and output, but only affects firewall filters applied to the lo0 interface as output.
This issue is applicable to IPv4 and IPv6 as a prefix list can contain IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes.
This issue affects Junos OS Evolved:

  *  23.2R2-S3-EVO versions before 23.2R2-S4-EVO,
  *  23.4R2-S3-EVO versions before 23.4R2-S5-EVO,
  *  24.2R2-EVO versions before 24.2R2-S1-EVO,
  *  24.4-EVO versions before 24.4R1-S3-EVO, 24.4R2-EVO.

      <title>CVE-2025-52948 - Juniper Networks Junos OS BPF Exceptional Condition Handling Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-52948
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 11, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker, in rare cases, sending specific, unknown traffic patterns to cause the FPC and system to crash and restart.

BPF provides a raw interface to data link layers in a protocol independent fashion. Internally within the Junos kernel, due to a rare timing issue (race condition), when a BPF instance is cloned, the newly created interface causes an internal structure leakage, leading to a system crash. The precise content and timing of the traffic patterns is indeterminate, but has been seen in a lab environment multiple times.

This issue is more likely to occur when packet capturing is enabled.  See required configuration below.

This issue affects Junos OS: 



  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9, 
  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10, 
  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6, 
  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S7,

      <title>CVE-2025-52950 - Juniper Networks Security Director Missing Authorization Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-52950
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 11, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A Missing Authorization vulnerability in Juniper Networks Security Director allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to read or tamper with multiple sensitive resources via the web interface.

Numerous endpoints on the Juniper Security Director appliance do not validate authorization and will deliver information to the caller that is outside their authorization level. An attacker can access data that is outside the user's authorization level. The information obtained can be used to gain access to additional information or perpetrate other attacks, impacting downstream managed devices.



This issue affects Security Director version 24.4.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-52951 - Juniper Networks Junos OS IPv6 Firewall Bypass Protection Mechanism Failure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-52951
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 11, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A Protection Mechanism Failure vulnerability in kernel filter processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker sending IPv6 traffic to an interface to effectively bypass any firewall filtering configured on the interface.

Due to an issue with Junos OS kernel filter processing, the 'payload-protocol' match is not being supported, causing any term containing it to accept all packets without taking any other action. In essence, these firewall filter terms were being processed as an 'accept' for all traffic on the interface.

This issue affects Junos OS: 



  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9, 
  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S11, 
  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S7, 
  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S7, 
  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S4, 
  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S5, 
  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2-S1, 
  *  from 24.4 before 24.4R1-S2, 24.4R2.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34098
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 1 minute ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A path traversal vulnerability exists in Riverbed SteelHead VCX appliances (confirmed in VCX255U 9.6.0a) due to improper input validation in the log filtering functionality exposed via the management web interface.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34100
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 1 minute ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unrestricted file upload vulnerability exists in BuilderEngine 3.5.0 via the integration of the elFinder 2.0 file manager and its use of the jQuery File Upload plugin. The plugin fails to properly validate or restrict file types or locations during upload operations, allowing an attacker to upload a malicious .php file and subsequently execute arbitrary PHP code on the server under the context of the web server process. While the root vulnerability lies within the jQuery File Upload component, BuilderEngine’s improper integration and lack of access controls expose this functionality to unauthenticated users, resulting in full remote code execution.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34102
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 1 minute ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in CryptoLog (PHP version, discontinued since 2009) due to a chained exploitation of SQL injection and command injection vulnerabilities. An unauthenticated attacker can gain shell access as the web server user by first exploiting a SQL injection flaw in login.php to bypass authentication, followed by command injection in logshares_ajax.php to execute arbitrary operating system commands.


The login bypass is achieved by submitting crafted SQL via the user POST parameter. Once authenticated, the attacker can abuse the lsid POST parameter in the logshares_ajax.php endpoint to inject and execute a command using $(...) syntax, resulting in code execution under the web context.


This exploitation path does not exist in the ASP.NET version of CryptoLog released since 2009.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53709
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Secure-upload is a data submission service that validates single-use tokens when accepting submissions to channels. The service only installed on a small number of environments.

Under specific circumstances, privileged users of secure-upload could have selected email templates not necessarily created for their enrollment when sending data upload requests.
Authenticated and privileged users of one enrollment could have abused an endpoint to redirect existing submission channels to a dataset they control.
An endpoint handling domain validation allowed unauthenticated users to enumerate existing enrollments.
Finally, other endpoints allowed enumerating if a resource with a known RID exists across enrollments.

The affected service has been patched with version 0.815.0 and automatically deployed to all Apollo-managed Foundry instances.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53542
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Headlamp is an extensible Kubernetes web UI. A command injection vulnerability was discovered in the codeSign.js script used in the macOS packaging workflow of the Kubernetes Headlamp project. This issue arises due to the improper use of Node.js's execSync() function with unsanitized input derived from environment variables, which can be influenced by an attacker. The variables ${teamID}, ${entitlementsPath}, and ${config.app} are dynamically derived from the environment or application config and passed directly to the shell command without proper escaping or argument separation. This exposes the system to command injection if any of the values contain malicious input. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.31.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-53549 - Matrix Rust SDK SQL Injection</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53549
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Matrix Rust SDK is a collection of libraries that make it easier to build Matrix clients in Rust. An SQL injection vulnerability in the EventCache::find_event_with_relations method of matrix-sdk 0.11 and 0.12 allows malicious room members to execute arbitrary SQL commands in Matrix clients that directly pass relation types provided by those room members into this method, when used with the default sqlite-based store backend. Exploitation is unlikely, as no known clients currently use the API in this manner. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.13.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53371
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>DiscordNotifications is an extension for MediaWiki that sends notifications of actions in your Wiki to a Discord channel. DiscordNotifications allows sending requests via curl and file_get_contents to arbitrary URLs set via $wgDiscordIncomingWebhookUrl and $wgDiscordAdditionalIncomingWebhookUrls. This allows for DOS by causing the server to read large files. SSRF is also possible if there are internal unprotected APIs that can be accessed using HTTP POST requests, which could also possibly lead to RCE. This vulnerability is fixed in commit 1f20d850cbcce5b15951c7c6127b87b927a5415e.

      <title>CVE-2024-43394 - Apache HTTP Server Windows SSRF NTLM Hash Leak</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-43394
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Apache HTTP Server on Windows allows to potentially leak NTLM hashes to a malicious server via 
mod_rewrite or apache expressions that pass unvalidated request input.

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.0 through 2.4.63.

Note:  The Apache HTTP Server Project will be setting a higher bar for accepting vulnerability reports regarding SSRF via UNC paths. 

The server offers limited protection against administrators directing the server to open UNC paths.
Windows servers should limit the hosts they will connect over via SMB based on the nature of NTLM authentication.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Insufficient escaping of user-supplied data in mod_ssl in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.63 and earlier allows an untrusted SSL/TLS client to insert escape characters into log files in some configurations.

In a logging configuration where CustomLog is used with "%{varname}x" or "%{varname}c" to log variables provided by mod_ssl such as SSL_TLS_SNI, no escaping is performed by either mod_log_config or mod_ssl and unsanitized data provided by the client may appear in log files.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In some mod_ssl configurations on Apache HTTP Server 2.4.35 through to 2.4.63, an access control bypass by trusted clients is possible using TLS 1.3 session resumption.

Configurations are affected when mod_ssl is configured for multiple virtual hosts, with each restricted to a different set of trusted client certificates (for example with a different SSLCACertificateFile/Path setting). In such a case, a client trusted to access one virtual host may be able to access another virtual host, if SSLStrictSNIVHostCheck is not enabled in either virtual host.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In Wing FTP Server through 7.4.4, the administrative web interface (listening by default on port 5466) runs as root or SYSTEM by default. The web application itself offers several legitimate ways to execute arbitrary system commands (i.e., through the web console or the task scheduler), and they are automatically executed in the highest possible privilege context. Because administrative users of the web interface are not necessarily also system administrators, one might argue that this is a privilege escalation. (If a privileged application role is not available to an attacker, CVE-2025-47812 can be leveraged.) NOTE: the vendor reportedly considers this behavior "fine to keep."

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In Wing FTP Server before 7.4.4. the user and admin web interfaces mishandle '\0' bytes, ultimately allowing injection of arbitrary Lua code into user session files. This can be used to execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the FTP service (root or SYSTEM by default). This is thus a remote code execution vulnerability that guarantees a total server compromise. This is also exploitable via anonymous FTP accounts.

      <title>CVE-2025-53364 - Parse Server GraphQL API Unauthenticated Schema Introspection</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53364
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.3 and 8.2.2.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6211
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in the DocugamiReader class of the run-llama/llama_index repository, up to version 0.12.28, involves the use of MD5 hashing to generate IDs for document chunks. This approach leads to hash collisions when structurally distinct chunks contain identical text, resulting in one chunk overwriting another. This can cause loss of semantically or legally important document content, breakage of parent-child chunk hierarchies, and inaccurate or hallucinated responses in AI outputs. The issue is resolved in version 0.3.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-38335 - Linux Kernel gpio-keys Soft Lockup Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38335
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: gpio-keys - fix a sleep while atomic with PREEMPT_RT

When enabling PREEMPT_RT, the gpio_keys_irq_timer() callback runs in
hard irq context, but the input_event() takes a spin_lock, which isn't
allowed there as it is converted to a rt_spin_lock().

[ 4054.289999] BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c:48
[ 4054.290028] in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 1, non_block: 0, pid: 0, name: swapper/0

Considering the gpio_keys_irq_isr() can run in any context, e.g. it can
be threaded, it seems there's no point in requesting the timer isr to
run in hard irq context.

Relax the hrtimer not to use the hard context.

      <title>CVE-2025-38336 - VIA ata DMA Hard Hang Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38336
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ata: pata_via: Force PIO for ATAPI devices on VT6415/VT6330

The controller has a hardware bug that can hard hang the system when
doing ATAPI DMAs without any trace of what happened. Depending on the
device attached, it can also prevent the system from booting.

In this case, the system hangs when reading the ATIP from optical media
with cdrecord -vvv -atip on an _NEC DVD_RW ND-4571A 1-01 and an
Optiarc DVD RW AD-7200A 1.06 attached to an ASRock 990FX Extreme 4,
running at UDMA/33.

The issue can be reproduced by running the same command with a cygwin
build of cdrecord on WinXP, although it requires more attempts to cause
it. The hang in that case is also resolved by forcing PIO. It doesn't
appear that VIA has produced any drivers for that OS, thus no known
workaround exists.

HDDs attached to the controller do not suffer from any DMA issues.

      <title>CVE-2025-38338 - "NFS Linux Kernel Deadlock and Unlocked Folio Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38338
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/nfs/read: fix double-unlock bug in nfs_return_empty_folio()

Sometimes, when a file was read while it was being truncated by
another NFS client, the kernel could deadlock because folio_unlock()
was called twice, and the second call would XOR back the `PG_locked`
flag.

Most of the time (depending on the timing of the truncation), nobody
notices the problem because folio_unlock() gets called three times,
which flips `PG_locked` back off:

 1. vfs_read, nfs_read_folio, ... nfs_read_add_folio,
    nfs_return_empty_folio
 2. vfs_read, nfs_read_folio, ... netfs_read_collection,
    netfs_unlock_abandoned_read_pages
 3. vfs_read, ... nfs_do_read_folio, nfs_read_add_folio,
    nfs_return_empty_folio

The problem is that nfs_read_add_folio() is not supposed to unlock the
folio if fscache is enabled, and a nfs_netfs_folio_unlock() check is
missing in nfs_return_empty_folio().

Rarely this leads to a warning in netfs_read_collection():

 ------------[ cut here ]------------
 R=0000031c: folio 10 is not locked
 WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 29 at fs/netfs/read_collect.c:133 netfs_read_collection+0x7c0/0xf00

Most of the time, however, processes just get stuck forever in
folio_wait_bit_common(), waiting for `PG_locked` to disappear, which
never happens because nobody is really holding the folio lock.

      <title>CVE-2025-38339 - Linux Kernel PowerPC BPF Trampoline JIT Code Size Calculation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38339
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/bpf: fix JIT code size calculation of bpf trampoline

arch_bpf_trampoline_size() provides JIT size of the BPF trampoline
before the buffer for JIT'ing it is allocated. The total number of
instructions emitted for BPF trampoline JIT code depends on where
the final image is located. So, the size arrived at with the dummy
pass in arch_bpf_trampoline_size() can vary from the actual size
needed in  arch_prepare_bpf_trampoline().  When the instructions
accounted in  arch_bpf_trampoline_size() is less than the number of
instructions emitted during the actual JIT compile of the trampoline,
the below warning is produced:

  WARNING: CPU: 8 PID: 204190 at arch/powerpc/net/bpf_jit_comp.c:981 __arch_prepare_bpf_trampoline.isra.0+0xd2c/0xdcc

which is:

  /* Make sure the trampoline generation logic doesn't overflow */
  if (image && WARN_ON_ONCE(&image[ctx->idx] >
  			(u32 *)rw_image_end - BPF_INSN_SAFETY)) {

So, during the dummy pass, instead of providing some arbitrary image
location, account for maximum possible instructions if and when there
is a dependency with image location for JIT'ing.

eth: fbnic: avoid double free when failing to DMA-map FW msg

The semantics are that caller of fbnic_mbx_map_msg() retains
the ownership of the message on error. All existing callers
dutifully free the page.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

software node: Correct a OOB check in software_node_get_reference_args()

software_node_get_reference_args() wants to get @index-th element, so
the property value requires at least '(index + 1) * sizeof(*ref)' bytes
but that can not be guaranteed by current OOB check, and may cause OOB
for malformed property.

Fix by using as OOB check '((index + 1) * sizeof(*ref) > prop->length)'.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPICA: fix acpi parse and parseext cache leaks

ACPICA commit 8829e70e1360c81e7a5a901b5d4f48330e021ea5

I'm Seunghun Han, and I work for National Security Research Institute of
South Korea.

I have been doing a research on ACPI and found an ACPI cache leak in ACPI
early abort cases.

Boot log of ACPI cache leak is as follows:

I analyzed this memory leak in detail. I found that “Acpi-State” cache and
“Acpi-Parse” cache were merged because the size of cache objects was same
slab cache size.

I finally found “Acpi-Parse” cache and “Acpi-parse_ext” cache were leaked
using SLAB_NEVER_MERGE flag in kmem_cache_create() function.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38345

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPICA: fix acpi operand cache leak in dswstate.c

ACPICA commit 987a3b5cf7175916e2a4b6ea5b8e70f830dfe732

I found an ACPI cache leak in ACPI early termination and boot continuing case.

When early termination occurs due to malicious ACPI table, Linux kernel
terminates ACPI function and continues to boot process. While kernel terminates
ACPI function, kmem_cache_destroy() reports Acpi-Operand cache leak.

Boot log of ACPI operand cache leak is as follows:

I analyzed this memory leak in detail and found acpi_ds_obj_stack_pop_and_
delete() function miscalculated the top of the stack. acpi_ds_obj_stack_push()
function uses walk_state->operand_index for start position of the top, but
acpi_ds_obj_stack_pop_and_delete() function considers index 0 for it.
Therefore, this causes acpi operand memory leak.

This cache leak causes a security threat because an old kernel (<= 4.9) shows
memory locations of kernel functions in stack dump. Some malicious users
could use this information to neutralize kernel ASLR.

I made a patch to fix ACPI operand cache leak.

The above issue may happen as follows:
(1) Add kprobe tracepoint;
(2) insmod test.ko;
(3)  Module triggers ftrace disabled;
(4) rmmod test.ko;
(5) cat /proc/kallsyms; --> Will trigger UAF as test.ko already removed;
ftrace_mod_get_kallsym()
...
strscpy(module_name, mod_map->mod->name, MODULE_NAME_LEN);
...

The problem is when a module triggers an issue with ftrace and
sets ftrace_disable. The ftrace_disable is set when an anomaly is
discovered and to prevent any more damage, ftrace stops all text
modification. The issue that happened was that the ftrace_disable stops
more than just the text modification.

When a module is loaded, its init functions can also be traced. Because
kallsyms deletes the init functions after a module has loaded, ftrace
saves them when the module is loaded and function tracing is enabled. This
allows the output of the function trace to show the init function names
instead of just their raw memory addresses.

When a module is removed, ftrace_release_mod() is called, and if
ftrace_disable is set, it just returns without doing anything more. The
problem here is that it leaves the mod_list still around and if kallsyms
is called, it will call into this code and access the module memory that
has already been freed as it will return:

  strscpy(module_name, mod_map->mod->name, MODULE_NAME_LEN);

Where the "mod" no longer exists and triggers a UAF bug.

      <title>CVE-2025-38348 - "Intersil p54 WiFi Interface Buffer Overflow Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38348
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: p54: prevent buffer-overflow in p54_rx_eeprom_readback()

Robert Morris reported:

|If a malicious USB device pretends to be an Intersil p54 wifi
|interface and generates an eeprom_readback message with a large
|eeprom->v1.len, p54_rx_eeprom_readback() will copy data from the
|message beyond the end of priv->eeprom.
|
|static void p54_rx_eeprom_readback(struct p54_common *priv,
|                                   struct sk_buff *skb)
|{
|        struct p54_hdr *hdr = (struct p54_hdr *) skb->data;
|        struct p54_eeprom_lm86 *eeprom = (struct p54_eeprom_lm86 *) hdr->data;
|
|        if (priv->fw_var >= 0x509) {
|                memcpy(priv->eeprom, eeprom->v2.data,
|                       le16_to_cpu(eeprom->v2.len));
|        } else {
|                memcpy(priv->eeprom, eeprom->v1.data,
|                       le16_to_cpu(eeprom->v1.len));
|        }
| [...]

The eeprom->v{1,2}.len is set by the driver in p54_download_eeprom().
The device is supposed to provide the same length back to the driver.
But yes, it's possible (like shown in the report) to alter the value
to something that causes a crash/panic due to overrun.

This patch addresses the issue by adding the size to the common device
context, so p54_rx_eeprom_readback no longer relies on possibly tampered
values... That said, it also checks if the "firmware" altered the value
and no longer copies them.

The one, small saving grace is: Before the driver tries to read the eeprom,
it needs to upload >a< firmware. the vendor firmware has a proprietary
license and as a reason, it is not present on most distributions by
default.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Use memcpy() for BIOS version

The strlcat() with FORTIFY support is triggering a panic because it
thinks the target buffer will overflow although the correct target
buffer size is passed in.

Anyway, instead of memset() with 0 followed by a strlcat(), just use
memcpy() and ensure that the resulting buffer is NULL terminated.

BIOSVersion is only used for the lpfc_printf_log() which expects a
properly terminated string.

      <title>CVE-2025-38334 - Linux Kernel SGX: Poisoned Page Reclaimer Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38334
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/sgx: Prevent attempts to reclaim poisoned pages

TL;DR: SGX page reclaim touches the page to copy its contents to
secondary storage. SGX instructions do not gracefully handle machine
checks. Despite this, the existing SGX code will try to reclaim pages
that it _knows_ are poisoned. Avoid even trying to reclaim poisoned pages.

The longer story:

Pages used by an enclave only get epc_page->poison set in
arch_memory_failure() but they currently stay on sgx_active_page_list until
sgx_encl_release(), with the SGX_EPC_PAGE_RECLAIMER_TRACKED flag untouched.

epc_page->poison is not checked in the reclaimer logic meaning that, if other
conditions are met, an attempt will be made to reclaim an EPC page that was
poisoned.  This is bad because 1. we don't want that page to end up added
to another enclave and 2. it is likely to cause one core to shut down
and the kernel to panic.

Specifically, reclaiming uses microcode operations including "EWB" which
accesses the EPC page contents to encrypt and write them out to non-SGX
memory.  Those operations cannot handle MCEs in their accesses other than
by putting the executing core into a special shutdown state (affecting
both threads with HT.)  The kernel will subsequently panic on the
remaining cores seeing the core didn't enter MCE handler(s) in time.

Call sgx_unmark_page_reclaimable() to remove the affected EPC page from
sgx_active_page_list on memory error to stop it being considered for
reclaiming.

Testing epc_page->poison in sgx_reclaim_pages() would also work but I assume
it's better to add code in the less likely paths.

The affected EPC page is not added to &node->sgx_poison_page_list until
later in sgx_encl_release()->sgx_free_epc_page() when it is EREMOVEd.
Membership on other lists doesn't change to avoid changing any of the
lists' semantics except for sgx_active_page_list.  There's a "TBD" comment
in arch_memory_failure() about pre-emptive actions, the goal here is not
to address everything that it may imply.

This also doesn't completely close the time window when a memory error
notification will be fatal (for a not previously poisoned EPC page) --
the MCE can happen after sgx_reclaim_pages() has selected its candidates
or even *inside* a microcode operation (actually easy to trigger due to
the amount of time spent in them.)

The spinlock in sgx_unmark_page_reclaimable() is safe because
memory_failure() runs in process context and no spinlocks are held,
explicitly noted in a mm/memory-failure.c comment.

      <title>CVE-2025-38330 - Linux Kernel Firmware cs_dsp Out-of-Bounds Memory Read Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38330
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: cs_dsp: Fix OOB memory read access in KUnit test (ctl cache)

KASAN reported out of bounds access - cs_dsp_ctl_cache_init_multiple_offsets().
The code uses mock_coeff_template.length_bytes (4 bytes) for register value
allocations. But later, this length is set to 8 bytes which causes
test code failures.

As fix, just remove the lenght override, keeping the original value 4
for all operations.

      <title>CVE-2025-38331 - "Cortina Ethernet NetEngine TCP Offload Engine Segmentation Quirk"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38331
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: cortina: Use TOE/TSO on all TCP

It is desireable to push the hardware accelerator to also
process non-segmented TCP frames: we pass the skb->len
to the "TOE/TSO" offloader and it will handle them.

Without this quirk the driver becomes unstable and lock
up and and crash.

I do not know exactly why, but it is probably due to the
TOE (TCP offload engine) feature that is coupled with the
segmentation feature - it is not possible to turn one
part off and not the other, either both TOE and TSO are
active, or neither of them.

Not having the TOE part active seems detrimental, as if
that hardware feature is not really supposed to be turned
off.

The datasheet says:

  "Based on packet parsing and TCP connection/NAT table
   lookup results, the NetEngine puts the packets
   belonging to the same TCP connection to the same queue
   for the software to process. The NetEngine puts
   incoming packets to the buffer or series of buffers
   for a jumbo packet. With this hardware acceleration,
   IP/TCP header parsing, checksum validation and
   connection lookup are offloaded from the software
   processing."

After numerous tests with the hardware locking up after
something between minutes and hours depending on load
using iperf3 I have concluded this is necessary to stabilize
the hardware.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53546
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Folo organizes feeds content into one timeline. Using pull_request_target on .github/workflows/auto-fix-lint-format-commit.yml can be exploited by attackers, since untrusted code can be executed having full access to secrets (from the base repo). By exploiting the vulnerability is possible to exfiltrate GITHUB_TOKEN which has high privileges. GITHUB_TOKEN can be used to completely overtake the repo since the token has content write privileges. This vulnerability is fixed in commit 585c6a591440cd39f92374230ac5d65d7dd23d6a.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7204
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In ConnectWise PSA versions older than 2025.9, a
vulnerability exists where authenticated users could gain access to sensitive
user information. Specific API requests were found to return an overly verbose
user object, which included encrypted password hashes for other users.
Authenticated users could then retrieve these hashes. 



An
attacker or privileged user could then use these exposed hashes to conduct
offline brute-force or dictionary attacks. Such attacks could lead to
credential compromise, allowing unauthorized access to accounts, and
potentially privilege escalation within the system.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38247
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

userns and mnt_idmap leak in open_tree_attr(2)

Once want_mount_setattr() has returned a positive, it does require
finish_mount_kattr() to release ->mnt_userns.  Failing do_mount_setattr()
does not change that.

As the result, we can end up leaking userns and possibly mnt_idmap as
well.

      <title>CVE-2025-38248 - Linux Kernel Bridge Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38248
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration

The bridge maintains a global list of ports behind which a multicast
router resides. The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure
multicast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not
member in the matching MDB entry.

When per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast
context is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global
router port list:

 # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1
 # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy
 # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2
 $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router
 router ports on br1: dummy1
 # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1
 $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router

However, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN
multicast snooping is enabled:

 # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0
 # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2
 $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router
 router ports on br1: dummy1

Since commit 4b30ae9adb04 ("net: bridge: mcast: re-implement
br_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions"), when per-VLAN multicast
snooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the
per-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a
result, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it
is deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is
traversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):

 # ip link del dev dummy1
 # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy
 # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2

Similarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port
list. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}
contexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the
per-VLAN router port list:

 # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1
 # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy
 # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1
 # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1
 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2
 $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router
       router ports: dummy1
 # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0
 $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router

However, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when
per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:

 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0
 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2
 $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router
       router ports: dummy1

When the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast
context will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled
on the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router
port list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead
to a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new
port to the list, for example):

 # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy
 # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2
 # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1
 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2

Fix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or
per-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The
function is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast
context and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast
context.

Note that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only
takes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the
permanent one (2).

      <title>CVE-2025-38249 - ALSA USB Audio Out-of-Bounds Read Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38249
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix out-of-bounds read in snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3()

In snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3(), the length value returned from
snd_usb_ctl_msg() is used directly for memory allocation without
validation. This length is controlled by the USB device.

The allocated buffer is cast to a uac3_cluster_header_descriptor
and its fields are accessed without verifying that the buffer
is large enough. If the device returns a smaller than expected
length, this leads to an out-of-bounds read.

Add a length check to ensure the buffer is large enough for
uac3_cluster_header_descriptor.

      <title>CVE-2025-38250 - "Bluetooth hci_core Use-After-Free Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38250
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_core: Fix use-after-free in vhci_flush()

syzbot reported use-after-free in vhci_flush() without repro. [0]

From the splat, a thread close()d a vhci file descriptor while
its device was being used by iotcl() on another thread.

Once the last fd refcnt is released, vhci_release() calls
hci_unregister_dev(), hci_free_dev(), and kfree() for struct
vhci_data, which is set to hci_dev->dev->driver_data.

The problem is that there is no synchronisation after unlinking
hdev from hci_dev_list in hci_unregister_dev().  There might be
another thread still accessing the hdev which was fetched before
the unlink operation.

We can use SRCU for such synchronisation.

Let's run hci_dev_reset() under SRCU and wait for its completion
in hci_unregister_dev().

Another option would be to restore hci_dev->destruct(), which was
removed in commit 587ae086f6e4 ("Bluetooth: Remove unused
hci-destruct cb").  However, this would not be a good solution, as
we should not run hci_unregister_dev() while there are in-flight
ioctl() requests, which could lead to another data-race KCSAN splat.

Note that other drivers seem to have the same problem, for exmaple,
virtbt_remove().

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl/ras: Fix CPER handler device confusion

By inspection, cxl_cper_handle_prot_err() is making a series of fragile
assumptions that can lead to crashes:

1/ It assumes that endpoints identified in the record are a CXL-type-3
   device, nothing guarantees that.

2/ It assumes that the device is bound to the cxl_pci driver, nothing
   guarantees that.

3/ Minor, it holds the device lock over the switch-port tracing for no
   reason as the trace is 100% generated from data in the record.

Correct those by checking that the PCIe endpoint parents a cxl_memdev
before assuming the format of the driver data, and move the lock to where
it is required. Consequently this also makes the implementation ready for
CXL accelerators that are not bound to cxl_pci.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: wacom: fix crash in wacom_aes_battery_handler()

Commit fd2a9b29dc9c ("HID: wacom: Remove AES power_supply after extended
inactivity") introduced wacom_aes_battery_handler() which is scheduled
as a delayed work (aes_battery_work).

In wacom_remove(), aes_battery_work is not canceled. Consequently, if
the device is removed while aes_battery_work is still pending, then hard
crashes or "Oops: general protection fault..." are experienced when
wacom_aes_battery_handler() is finally called. E.g., this happens with
built-in USB devices after resume from hibernate when aes_battery_work
was still pending at the time of hibernation.

So, take care to cancel aes_battery_work in wacom_remove().

<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Add sanity checks for drm_edid_raw()

When EDID is retrieved via drm_edid_raw(), it doesn't guarantee to
return proper EDID bytes the caller wants: it may be either NULL (that
leads to an Oops) or with too long bytes over the fixed size raw_edid
array (that may lead to memory corruption).  The latter was reported
actually when connected with a bad adapter.

Add sanity checks for drm_edid_raw() to address the above corner
cases, and return EDID_BAD_INPUT accordingly.

(cherry picked from commit 648d3f4d209725d51900d6a3ed46b7b600140cdf)

Root cause is that numgrps is set to 0, and ZERO_SIZE_PTR is returned from

Fix the problem by checking numgrps first in group_cpus_evenly(), and
return NULL directly if numgrps is zero.

We can pin a tail page of a folio, but then io_uring will try to unpin
the head page of the folio. While it should be fine in terms of keeping
the page actually alive, mm folks say it's wrong and triggers a debug
warning. Use unpin_user_folio() instead of unpin_user_page*.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38257
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/pkey: Prevent overflow in size calculation for memdup_user()

Number of apqn target list entries contained in 'nr_apqns' variable is
determined by userspace via an ioctl call so the result of the product in
calculation of size passed to memdup_user() may overflow.

In this case the actual size of the allocated area and the value
describing it won't be in sync leading to various types of unpredictable
behaviour later.

Use a proper memdup_array_user() helper which returns an error if an
overflow is detected. Note that it is different from when nr_apqns is
initially zero - that case is considered valid and should be handled in
subsequent pkey_handler implementations.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org).

Driver gets and enables all regulator supplies in probe path
(wcd9335_parse_dt() and wcd9335_power_on_reset()), but does not cleanup
in final error paths and in unbind (missing remove() callback).  This
leads to leaked memory and unbalanced regulator enable count during
probe errors or unbind.

Fix this by converting entire code into devm_regulator_bulk_get_enable()
which also greatly simplifies the code.

[CAUSE]
Firstly the fs has a corrupted csum tree root, thus to mount the fs we
have to go "ro,rescue=ibadroots" mount option.

Normally with that mount option, a bad csum tree root should set
BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS flag, so that any future data read will
ignore csum search.

But in this particular case, we have the following call trace that
caused NULL csum root, but not setting BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS:

load_global_roots_objectid():

		ret = btrfs_search_slot();
		/* Succeeded */
		btrfs_item_key_to_cpu()
		found = true;
		/* We found the root item for csum tree. */
		root = read_tree_root_path();
		if (IS_ERR(root)) {
			if (!btrfs_test_opt(fs_info, IGNOREBADROOTS))
			/*
			 * Since we have rescue=ibadroots mount option,
			 * @ret is still 0.
			 */
			break;
	if (!found || ret) {
		/* @found is true, @ret is 0, error handling for csum
		 * tree is skipped.
		 */
	}

This means we completely skipped to set BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS if
the csum tree is corrupted, which results unexpected later csum lookup.

[FIX]
If read_tree_root_path() failed, always populate @ret to the error
number.

As at the end of the function, we need @ret to determine if we need to
do the extra error handling for csum tree.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: save the SR_SUM status over switches

When threads/tasks are switched we need to ensure the old execution's
SR_SUM state is saved and the new thread has the old SR_SUM state
restored.

The issue was seen under heavy load especially with the syz-stress tool
running, with crashes as follows in schedule_tail:

---[ end trace b5f8f9231dc87dda ]---

The issue comes from the put_user() in schedule_tail
(kernel/sched/core.c) doing the following:

asmlinkage __visible void schedule_tail(struct task_struct *prev)
{
...
        if (current->set_child_tid)
                put_user(task_pid_vnr(current), current->set_child_tid);
...
}

the put_user() macro causes the code sequence to come out as follows:

1:	__enable_user_access()
2:	reg = task_pid_vnr(current);
3:	*current->set_child_tid = reg;
4:	__disable_user_access()

The problem is that we may have a sleeping function as argument which
could clear SR_SUM causing the panic above. This was fixed by
evaluating the argument of the put_user() macro outside the user-enabled
section in commit 285a76bb2cf5 ("riscv: evaluate put_user() arg before
enabling user access")"

In order for riscv to take advantage of unsafe_get/put_XXX() macros and
to avoid the same issue we had with put_user() and sleeping functions we
must ensure code flow can go through switch_to() from within a region of
code with SR_SUM enabled and come back with SR_SUM still enabled. This
patch addresses the problem allowing future work to enable full use of
unsafe_get/put_XXX() macros without needing to take a CSR bit flip cost
on every access. Make switch_to() save and restore SR_SUM.

occur. If one thread calls uart_register_driver function, which first
allocates and assigns memory to 'uart_state' member of uart_driver
structure, the other instance can bypass uart driver registration and
call ulite_assign. This calls uart_add_one_port, which expects the uart
driver to be fully initialized. This leads to a kernel panic due to a
null pointer dereference:

To prevent it, move uart driver registration in to init function. This
will ensure that uart_driver is always registered when probe function
is called.

The reason is simple, readahead brought some order 0 folio in swap cache,
and the swapin mTHP folio being allocated is in conflict with it, so
swapcache_prepare fails and causes shmem_swap_alloc_folio to return
-EEXIST, and shmem simply retries again and again causing this loop.

Fix it by applying a similar fix for anon mTHP swapin.

The performance change is very slight, time of swapin 10g zero folios
with shmem (test for 12 times):
Before:  2.47s
After:   2.48s

      <title>CVE-2025-38242 - Linux Kernel Userfaultfd Swap Cache Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38242
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: userfaultfd: fix race of userfaultfd_move and swap cache

This commit fixes two kinds of races, they may have different results:

Barry reported a BUG_ON in commit c50f8e6053b0, we may see the same
BUG_ON if the filemap lookup returned NULL and folio is added to swap
cache after that.

If another kind of race is triggered (folio changed after lookup) we
may see RSS counter is corrupted:

[  406.893936] BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:ffff0000c5a9ddc0
type:MM_ANONPAGES val:-1
[  406.894071] BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:ffff0000c5a9ddc0
type:MM_SHMEMPAGES val:1

Because the folio is being accounted to the wrong VMA.

I'm not sure if there will be any data corruption though, seems no. 
The issues above are critical already.


On seeing a swap entry PTE, userfaultfd_move does a lockless swap cache
lookup, and tries to move the found folio to the faulting vma.  Currently,
it relies on checking the PTE value to ensure that the moved folio still
belongs to the src swap entry and that no new folio has been added to the
swap cache, which turns out to be unreliable.

While working and reviewing the swap table series with Barry, following
existing races are observed and reproduced [1]:

In the example below, move_pages_pte is moving src_pte to dst_pte, where
src_pte is a swap entry PTE holding swap entry S1, and S1 is not in the
swap cache:

CPU1                               CPU2
userfaultfd_move
  move_pages_pte()
    entry = pte_to_swp_entry(orig_src_pte);
    // Here it got entry = S1
    ... < interrupted> ...
                                   <swapin src_pte, alloc and use folio A>
                                   // folio A is a new allocated folio
                                   // and get installed into src_pte
                                   <frees swap entry S1>
                                   // src_pte now points to folio A, S1
                                   // has swap count == 0, it can be freed
                                   // by folio_swap_swap or swap
                                   // allocator's reclaim.
                                   <try to swap out another folio B>
                                   // folio B is a folio in another VMA.
                                   <put folio B to swap cache using S1 >
                                   // S1 is freed, folio B can use it
                                   // for swap out with no problem.
                                   ...
    folio = filemap_get_folio(S1)
    // Got folio B here !!!
    ... < interrupted again> ...
                                   <swapin folio B and free S1>
                                   // Now S1 is free to be used again.
                                   <swapout src_pte & folio A using S1>
                                   // Now src_pte is a swap entry PTE

      folio_move_anon_rmap(...)
      // Moved invalid folio B here !!!

The race window is very short and requires multiple collisions of multiple
rare events, so it's very unlikely to happen, but with a deliberately
constructed reproducer and increased time window, it can be reproduced
easily.

This can be fixed by checking if the folio returned by filemap is the
valid swap cache folio after acquiring the folio lock.

Another similar race is possible: filemap_get_folio may return NULL, but
folio (A) could be swapped in and then swapped out again using the same
swap entry after the lookup.  In such a case, folio (A) may remain in the
swap cache, so it must be moved too:

CPU1                               CPU2
userfaultfd_move
  move_pages_pte()
    entry = pte_to_swp_entry(orig_src_pte);
    // Here it got entry = S1, and S1 is not in swap cache
    folio = filemap_get

      <title>CVE-2025-38243 - "Linux Btrfs Null Pointer Dereference Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38243
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix invalid inode pointer dereferences during log replay

In a few places where we call read_one_inode(), if we get a NULL pointer
we end up jumping into an error path, or fallthrough in case of
__add_inode_ref(), where we then do something like this:

   iput(&inode->vfs_inode);

which results in an invalid inode pointer that triggers an invalid memory
access, resulting in a crash.

Fix this by making sure we don't do such dereferences.

      <title>CVE-2025-38245 - "Google Compute Engine atm Device Registration Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38245
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

atm: Release atm_dev_mutex after removing procfs in atm_dev_deregister().

syzbot reported a warning below during atm_dev_register(). [0]

Before creating a new device and procfs/sysfs for it, atm_dev_register()
looks up a duplicated device by __atm_dev_lookup().  These operations are
done under atm_dev_mutex.

However, when removing a device in atm_dev_deregister(), it releases the
mutex just after removing the device from the list that __atm_dev_lookup()
iterates over.

So, there will be a small race window where the device does not exist on
the device list but procfs/sysfs are still not removed, triggering the
splat.

Let's hold the mutex until procfs/sysfs are removed in
atm_dev_deregister().

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6742
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 9 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The SureForms – Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.3 via the use of file_exists() in the delete_entry_files() function without restriction on the path provided. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34077
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the WordPress Pie Register plugin ≤ 3.7.1.4 that allows unauthenticated attackers to impersonate arbitrary users by submitting a crafted POST request to the login endpoint. By setting social_site=true and manipulating the user_id_social_site parameter, an attacker can generate a valid WordPress session cookie for any user ID, including administrators. Once authenticated, the attacker may exploit plugin upload functionality to install a malicious plugin containing arbitrary PHP code, resulting in remote code execution on the underlying server.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34083
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unrestricted file upload vulnerability exists in the WordPress AIT CSV Import/Export plugin ≤ 3.0.3. The plugin exposes an upload handler at upload-handler.php that allows arbitrary file upload via a multipart/form-data POST request. This endpoint does not enforce authentication or content-type validation, enabling attackers to upload malicious PHP code directly to the server. Although the upload may produce an error related to CSV parsing, the malicious file is still saved under wp-content/uploads/ and remains executable. Notably, the plugin does not need to be active for exploitation to succeed.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34084
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unauthenticated information disclosure vulnerability exists in the WordPress Total Upkeep plugin (also known as BoldGrid Backup) prior to version 1.14.10. The plugin exposes multiple endpoints that allow unauthenticated users to retrieve detailed server configuration (env-info.php) and discover backup metadata (restore-info.json). These backups, which may include full SQL database dumps, are accessible without authentication if their paths are known or guessed. The restore-info.json endpoint discloses the absolute filesystem path of the latest backup, which attackers can convert into a web-accessible URL under wp-content/uploads/ and download. Extracting the database archive may yield credential hashes from the wp_users table, facilitating offline password cracking or credential stuffing attacks.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34085
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the WordPress Simple File List plugin prior to version 4.2.3 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to achieve remote code execution. The plugin's upload endpoint (ee-upload-engine.php) restricts file uploads based on extension, but lacks proper validation after file renaming. An attacker can first upload a PHP payload disguised as a .png file, then use the plugin’s ee-file-engine.php rename functionality to change the extension to .php. This bypasses upload restrictions and results in the uploaded payload being executable on the server.

      <title>CVE-2025-53547 - Helm Chart File Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53547
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 14 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Prior to 3.18.4, a specially crafted Chart.yaml file along with a specially linked Chart.lock file can lead to local code execution when dependencies are updated. Fields in a Chart.yaml file, that are carried over to a Chart.lock file when dependencies are updated and this file is written, can be crafted in a way that can cause execution if that same content were in a file that is executed (e.g., a bash.rc file or shell script). If the Chart.lock file is symlinked to one of these files updating dependencies will write the lock file content to the symlinked file. This can lead to unwanted execution. Helm warns of the symlinked file but did not stop execution due to symlinking. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.18.4.

      <title>CVE-2025-48384 - Git Symlink Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48384
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-48385 - Git Bundle Protocol Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48385
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When cloning a repository Git knows to optionally fetch a bundle advertised by the remote server, which allows the server-side to offload parts of the clone to a CDN. The Git client does not perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles, which allows the remote side to perform protocol injection. This protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched bundle to a location controlled by the adversary. The fetched content is fully controlled by the server, which can in the worst case lead to arbitrary code execution. The use of bundle URIs is not enabled by default and can be controlled by the bundle.heuristic config option. Some cases of the vulnerability require that the adversary is in control of where a repository will be cloned to. This either requires social engineering or a recursive clone with submodules. These cases can thus be avoided by disabling recursive clones. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48386
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. The wincred credential helper uses a static buffer (target) as a unique key for storing and comparing against internal storage. This credential helper does not properly bounds check the available space remaining in the buffer before appending to it with wcsncat(), leading to potential buffer overflows. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53372
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>node-code-sandbox-mcp is a Node.js–based Model Context Protocol server that spins up disposable Docker containers to execute arbitrary JavaScript. Prior to 1.3.0, a command injection vulnerability exists in the node-code-sandbox-mcp MCP Server. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to child_process.execSync, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges on the host machine, bypassing the sandbox protection of running code inside docker. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.3.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-38236 - Linux Unix af_unix Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38236
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 3 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Don't leave consecutive consumed OOB skbs.

Jann Horn reported a use-after-free in unix_stream_read_generic().

The following sequences reproduce the issue:

  $ python3
  from socket import *
  s1, s2 = socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM)
  s1.send(b'x', MSG_OOB)
  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb
  s1.send(b'y', MSG_OOB)
  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb
  s1.send(b'z', MSG_OOB)
  s2.recv(1)              # recv 'z' illegally
  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # access 'z' skb (use-after-free)

Even though a user reads OOB data, the skb holding the data stays on
the recv queue to mark the OOB boundary and break the next recv().

After the last send() in the scenario above, the sk2's recv queue has
2 leading consumed OOB skbs and 1 real OOB skb.

Then, the following happens during the next recv() without MSG_OOB

  1. unix_stream_read_generic() peeks the first consumed OOB skb
  2. manage_oob() returns the next consumed OOB skb
  3. unix_stream_read_generic() fetches the next not-yet-consumed OOB skb
  4. unix_stream_read_generic() reads and frees the OOB skb

, and the last recv(MSG_OOB) triggers KASAN splat.

The 3. above occurs because of the SO_PEEK_OFF code, which does not
expect unix_skb_len(skb) to be 0, but this is true for such consumed
OOB skbs.

  while (skip >= unix_skb_len(skb)) {
    skip -= unix_skb_len(skb);
    skb = skb_peek_next(skb, &sk->sk_receive_queue);
    ...
  }

In addition to this use-after-free, there is another issue that
ioctl(SIOCATMARK) does not function properly with consecutive consumed
OOB skbs.

So, nothing good comes out of such a situation.

Instead of complicating manage_oob(), ioctl() handling, and the next
ECONNRESET fix by introducing a loop for consecutive consumed OOB skbs,
let's not leave such consecutive OOB unnecessarily.

Now, while receiving an OOB skb in unix_stream_recv_urg(), if its
previous skb is a consumed OOB skb, it is freed.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-20325
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 54 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.4.3, 9.3.5, 9.2.7, and 9.1.10, and Splunk Cloud Platform versions below 9.3.2411.103, 9.3.2408.113, and 9.2.2406.119, the software potentially exposes the search head cluster [splunk.secret](https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/administer/manage-users-and-security/9.4/install-splunk-enterprise-securely/deploy-secure-passwords-across-multiple-servers) key. This exposure could happen if you have a Search Head cluster and you configure the Splunk Enterprise `SHCConfig` log channel at the DEBUG logging level in the clustered deployment. <br><br>The vulnerability would require either local access to the log files or administrative access to internal indexes, which by default only the admin role receives. Review roles and capabilities on your instance and restrict internal index access to administrator-level roles. <br><br>See [Define roles on the Splunk platform with capabilities](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/Rolesandcapabilities), [Deploy a search head cluster](https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/administer/distributed-search/9.4/deploy-search-head-clustering/deploy-a-search-head-cluster), [Deploy secure passwords across multiple servers](https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/administer/manage-users-and-security/9.4/install-splunk-enterprise-securely/deploy-secure-passwords-across-multiple-servers) and [Set a security key for the search head cluster](https://help.splunk.com/splunk-enterprise/administer/distributed-search/9.4/configure-search-head-clustering/set-a-security-key-for-the-search-head-cluster#id_2c54937a_736c_47b5_9485_67e9e390acfa__Set_a_security_key_for_the_search_head_cluster)  for more information.

      <title>CVE-2025-53536 - Roo Code Code Execution Vulnerability (Arbitrary Command Injection)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53536
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 54 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent. Prior to 3.22.6, if the victim had "Write" auto-approved, an attacker with the ability to submit prompts to the agent could write to VS Code settings files and trigger code execution. There were multiple ways to achieve that. One example is with the php.validate.executablePath setting which lets you set the path for the php executable for syntax validation. The attacker could have written the path to an arbitrary command there and then created a php file to trigger it. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.22.6.

      <title>CVE-2025-32023 - Redis Heap Out-of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32023
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 38 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. From 2.8 to before 8.0.3, 7.4.5, 7.2.10, and 6.2.19, an authenticated user may use a specially crafted string to trigger a stack/heap out of bounds write on hyperloglog operations, potentially leading to remote code execution. The bug likely affects all Redis versions with hyperloglog operations implemented. This vulnerability is fixed in 8.0.3, 7.4.5, 7.2.10, and 6.2.19. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing hyperloglog operations. This can be done using ACL to restrict HLL commands.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-5987
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 39 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A flaw was found in libssh when using the ChaCha20 cipher with the OpenSSL library. If an attacker manages to exhaust the heap space, this error is not detected and may lead to libssh using a partially initialized cipher context. This occurs because the OpenSSL error code returned aliases with the SSH_OK code, resulting in libssh not properly detecting the error returned by the OpenSSL library. This issue can lead to undefined behavior, including compromised data confidentiality and integrity or crashes.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6209
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A path traversal vulnerability exists in run-llama/llama_index versions 0.12.27 through 0.12.40, specifically within the `encode_image` function in `generic_utils.py`. This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the `image_path` input to read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files. The issue arises due to improper validation or sanitization of the file path, enabling path traversal sequences to access files outside the intended directory.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3262
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the huggingface/transformers repository, specifically in version 4.49.0. The vulnerability is due to inefficient regular expression complexity in the `SETTING_RE` variable within the `transformers/commands/chat.py` file.

      <title>CVE-2025-6210 - ObsidianReader Hardlink-Based Path Traversal Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6210
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in the ObsidianReader class of the run-llama/llama_index repository, specifically in version 0.12.27, allows for hardlink-based path traversal. This flaw permits attackers to bypass path restrictions and access sensitive system files, such as /etc/passwd, by exploiting hardlinks. The vulnerability arises from inadequate handling of hardlinks in the load_data() method, where the security checks fail to differentiate between real files and hardlinks. This issue is resolved in version 0.5.2.

      <title>CVE-2025-6386 - Apache Parisneo Timing Attack in Lollms Authentication</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6386
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The parisneo/lollms repository is affected by a timing attack vulnerability in the `authenticate_user` function within the `lollms_authentication.py` file. This vulnerability allows attackers to enumerate valid usernames and guess passwords incrementally by analyzing response time differences. The affected version is the latest, and the issue is resolved in version 20.1. The vulnerability arises from the use of Python's default string equality operator for password comparison, which compares characters sequentially and exits on the first mismatch, leading to variable response times based on the number of matching initial characters.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3108
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 6, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A critical deserialization vulnerability exists in the run-llama/llama_index library's JsonPickleSerializer component, affecting versions v0.12.27 through v0.12.40. This vulnerability allows remote code execution due to an insecure fallback to Python's pickle module. JsonPickleSerializer prioritizes deserialization using pickle.loads(), which can execute arbitrary code when processing untrusted data. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious payloads to achieve full system compromise. The root cause includes an insecure fallback mechanism, lack of validation or safeguards, misleading design, and violation of Python security guidelines.

      <title>CVE-2025-38235 - "Linux HID Backlight Reference Leak"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38235
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 6, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 13 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: appletb-kbd: fix "appletb_backlight" backlight device reference counting

During appletb_kbd_probe, probe attempts to get the backlight device
by name. When this happens backlight_device_get_by_name looks for a
device in the backlight class which has name "appletb_backlight" and
upon finding a match it increments the reference count for the device
and returns it to the caller. However this reference is never released
leading to a reference leak.

Fix this by decrementing the backlight device reference count on removal
via put_device and on probe failure.

      <title>CVE-2025-48952 - NetAlertX SHA-256 Magic Hash Login Bypass Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48952
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 22 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>NetAlertX is a network, presence scanner, and alert framework. Prior to version 25.6.7, a vulnerability in the authentication logic allows users to bypass password verification using SHA-256 magic hashes, due to loose comparison in PHP. In vulnerable versions of the application, a password comparison is performed using the `==` operator at line 40 in front/index.php. This introduces a security issue where specially crafted "magic hash" values that evaluate to true in a loose comparison can bypass authentication. Because of the use of `==` instead of the strict `===`, different strings that begin with 0e and are followed by only digits can be interpreted as scientific notation (i.e., zero) and treated as equal. This issue falls under the Login Bypass vulnerability class. Users with certain "weird" passwords that produce magic hashes are particularly affected. Services relying on this logic are at risk of unauthorized access. Version 25.6.7 fixes the vulnerability.
<br>

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 23 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The MCP Python SDK, called `mcp` on PyPI, is a Python implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Prior to version 1.10.0, if a client deliberately triggers an exception after establishing a streamable HTTP session, this can lead to an uncaught ClosedResourceError on the server side, causing the server to crash and requiring a restart to restore service. Impact may vary depending on the deployment conditions, and presence of infrastructure-level resilience measures. Version 1.10.0 contains a patch for the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-49601 - MbedTLS LMS Public Key Buffer Out-of-Bounds Read</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-49601
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 16 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In MbedTLS 3.3.0 before 3.6.4, mbedtls_lms_import_public_key does not check that the input buffer is at least 4 bytes before reading a 32-bit field, allowing a possible out-of-bounds read on truncated input. Specifically, an out-of-bounds read in mbedtls_lms_import_public_key allows context-dependent attackers to trigger a crash or limited adjacent-memory disclosure by supplying a truncated LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature) public-key buffer under four bytes. An LMS public key starts with a 4-byte type indicator. The function mbedtls_lms_import_public_key reads this type indicator before validating the size of its input.

      <title>CVE-2025-49600 - MbedTLS LMS Signature Forgery Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-49600
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 12 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In MbedTLS 3.3.0 before 3.6.4, mbedtls_lms_verify may accept invalid signatures if hash computation fails and internal errors go unchecked, enabling LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature) forgery in a fault scenario. Specifically, unchecked return values in mbedtls_lms_verify allow an attacker (who can induce a hardware hash accelerator fault) to bypass LMS signature verification by reusing stale stack data, resulting in acceptance of an invalid signature. In mbedtls_lms_verify, the return values of the internal Merkle tree functions create_merkle_leaf_value and create_merkle_internal_value are not checked. These functions return an integer that indicates whether the call succeeded or not. If a failure occurs, the output buffer (Tc_candidate_root_node) may remain uninitialized, and the result of the signature verification is unpredictable. When the software implementation of SHA-256 is used, these functions will not fail. However, with hardware-accelerated hashing, an attacker could use fault injection against the accelerator to bypass verification.

      <title>CVE-2025-38234 - Linux Kernel Sched/rt: Push Rt Task Race Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38234
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/rt: Fix race in push_rt_task

Overview
========
When a CPU chooses to call push_rt_task and picks a task to push to
another CPU's runqueue then it will call find_lock_lowest_rq method
which would take a double lock on both CPUs' runqueues. If one of the
locks aren't readily available, it may lead to dropping the current
runqueue lock and reacquiring both the locks at once. During this window
it is possible that the task is already migrated and is running on some
other CPU. These cases are already handled. However, if the task is
migrated and has already been executed and another CPU is now trying to
wake it up (ttwu) such that it is queued again on the runqeue
(on_rq is 1) and also if the task was run by the same CPU, then the
current checks will pass even though the task was migrated out and is no
longer in the pushable tasks list.

Crashes
=======
This bug resulted in quite a few flavors of crashes triggering kernel
panics with various crash signatures such as assert failures, page
faults, null pointer dereferences, and queue corruption errors all
coming from scheduler itself.

      <title>CVE-2025-46733 - OP-TEE Secure Storage API Panic Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46733
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>OP-TEE is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) designed as companion to a non-secure Linux kernel running on Arm; Cortex-A cores using the TrustZone technology. In version 4.5.0, using a specially crafted tee-supplicant binary running in REE userspace, an attacker can trigger a panic in a TA that uses the libutee Secure Storage API. Many functions in libutee, specifically those which make up the Secure Storage API, will panic if a system call returns an unexpected return code. This behavior is mandated by the TEE Internal Core API specification. However, in OP-TEE’s implementation, return codes of secure storage operations are passed through unsanitized from the REE tee-supplicant, through the Linux kernel tee-driver, through the OP-TEE kernel, back to libutee. Thus, an attacker with access to REE userspace, and the ability to stop tee-supplicant and replace it with their own process (generally trivial for a root user, and depending on the way permissions are set up, potentially available even to less privileged users) can run a malicious tee-supplicant process that responds to storage requests with unexpected response codes, triggering a panic in the requesting TA. This is particularly dangerous for TAs built with `TA_FLAG_SINGLE_INSTANCE` (corresponding to `gpd.ta.singleInstance` and `TA_FLAG_INSTANCE_KEEP_ALIVE` (corresponding to `gpd.ta.keepAlive`). The behavior of these TAs may depend on memory that is preserved between sessions, and the ability of an attacker to panic the TA and reload it with a clean memory space can compromise the behavior of those TAs. A critical example of this is the optee_ftpm TA. It uses the kept alive memory to hold PCR values, which crucially must be non-resettable. An attacker who can trigger a panic in the fTPM TA can reset the PCRs, and then extend them PCRs with whatever they choose, falsifying boot measurements, accessing sealed data, and potentially more. The impact of this issue depends significantly on the behavior of affected TAs. For some, it could manifest as a denial of service, while for others, like the fTPM TA, it can result in the disclosure of sensitive data. Anyone running the fTPM TA is affected, but similar attacks may be possible on other TAs that leverage the Secure Storage API. A fix is available in commit 941a58d78c99c4754fbd4ec3079ec9e1d596af8f.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: cxusb: no longer judge rbuf when the write fails

syzbot reported a uninit-value in cxusb_i2c_xfer. [1]

Only when the write operation of usb_bulk_msg() in dvb_usb_generic_rw()
succeeds and rlen is greater than 0, the read operation of usb_bulk_msg()
will be executed to read rlen bytes of data from the dvb device into the
rbuf.

In this case, although rlen is 1, the write operation failed which resulted
in the dvb read operation not being executed, and ultimately variable i was
not initialized.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38230
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: validate AG parameters in dbMount() to prevent crashes

Validate db_agheight, db_agwidth, and db_agstart in dbMount to catch
corrupted metadata early and avoid undefined behavior in dbAllocAG.
Limits are derived from L2LPERCTL, LPERCTL/MAXAG, and CTLTREESIZE:

- agheight: 0 to L2LPERCTL/2 (0 to 5) ensures shift
  (L2LPERCTL - 2*agheight) >= 0.
- agwidth: 1 to min(LPERCTL/MAXAG, 2^(L2LPERCTL - 2*agheight))
  ensures agperlev >= 1.
  - Ranges: 1-8 (agheight 0-3), 1-4 (agheight 4), 1 (agheight 5).
  - LPERCTL/MAXAG = 1024/128 = 8 limits leaves per AG;
    2^(10 - 2*agheight) prevents division to 0.
- agstart: 0 to CTLTREESIZE-1 - agwidth*(MAXAG-1) keeps ti within
  stree (size 1365).
  - Ranges: 0-1237 (agwidth 1), 0-348 (agwidth 8).

      <title>CVE-2025-38231 - Linux Kernel NFSd NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38231
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: Initialize ssc before laundromat_work to prevent NULL dereference

In nfs4_state_start_net(), laundromat_work may access nfsd_ssc through
nfs4_laundromat -> nfsd4_ssc_expire_umount. If nfsd_ssc isn't initialized,
this can cause NULL pointer dereference.

Normally the delayed start of laundromat_work allows sufficient time for
nfsd_ssc initialization to complete. However, when the kernel waits too
long for userspace responses (e.g. in nfs4_state_start_net ->
nfsd4_end_grace -> nfsd4_record_grace_done -> nfsd4_cld_grace_done ->
cld_pipe_upcall -> __cld_pipe_upcall -> wait_for_completion path), the
delayed work may start before nfsd_ssc initialization finishes.

Fix this by moving nfsd_ssc initialization before starting laundromat_work.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: fix race between nfsd registration and exports_proc

As of now nfsd calls create_proc_exports_entry() at start of init_nfsd
and cleanup by remove_proc_entry() at last of exit_nfsd.

Which causes kernel OOPs if there is race between below 2 operations:
(i) exportfs -r
(ii) mount -t nfsd none /proc/fs/nfsd

It reproduced simply with below script:
while [ 1 ]
do
/exportfs -r
done &

while [ 1 ]
do
insmod /nfsd.ko
mount -t nfsd none /proc/fs/nfsd
umount /proc/fs/nfsd
rmmod nfsd
done &

So exporting interfaces to user space shall be done at last and
cleanup at first place.

With change there is no Kernel OOPs.

      <title>CVE-2025-38224 - Kvaser PCIEFD Linux Kernel Slab Out-of-Bounds Write</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38224
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 7 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: kvaser_pciefd: refine error prone echo_skb_max handling logic

echo_skb_max should define the supported upper limit of echo_skb[]
allocated inside the netdevice's priv. The corresponding size value
provided by this driver to alloc_candev() is KVASER_PCIEFD_CAN_TX_MAX_COUNT
which is 17.

But later echo_skb_max is rounded up to the nearest power of two (for the
max case, that would be 32) and the tx/ack indices calculated further
during tx/rx may exceed the upper array boundary. Kasan reported this for
the ack case inside kvaser_pciefd_handle_ack_packet(), though the xmit
function has actually caught the same thing earlier.

 BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in kvaser_pciefd_handle_ack_packet+0x2d7/0x92a drivers/net/can/kvaser_pciefd.c:1528

Tx max count definitely matters for kvaser_pciefd_tx_avail(), but for seq
numbers' generation that's not the case - we're free to calculate them as
would be more convenient, not taking tx max count into account. The only
downside is that the size of echo_skb[] should correspond to the max seq
number (not tx max count), so in some situations a bit more memory would
be consumed than could be.

Thus make the size of the underlying echo_skb[] sufficient for the rounded
max tx value.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38225
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 7 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: imx-jpeg: Cleanup after an allocation error

When allocation failures are not cleaned up by the driver, further
allocation errors will be false-positives, which will cause buffers to
remain uninitialized and cause NULL pointer dereferences.
Ensure proper cleanup of failed allocations to prevent these issues.

      <title>CVE-2025-38221 - Linux Kernel ext4 Out-of-Bounds Punch Offset Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38221
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix out of bounds punch offset

Punching a hole with a start offset that exceeds max_end is not
permitted and will result in a negative length in the
truncate_inode_partial_folio() function while truncating the page cache,
potentially leading to undesirable consequences.

A simple reproducer:

  truncate -s 9895604649994 /mnt/foo
  xfs_io -c "pwrite 8796093022208 4096" /mnt/foo
  xfs_io -c "fpunch 8796093022213 25769803777" /mnt/foo

      <title>CVE-2025-38222 - Linux ext4 Inline Data Overflow</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38222
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: inline: fix len overflow in ext4_prepare_inline_data

When running the following code on an ext4 filesystem with inline_data
feature enabled, it will lead to the bug below.

        fd = open("file1", O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0666);
        ftruncate(fd, 30);
        pwrite(fd, "a", 1, (1UL << 40) + 5UL);

That happens because write_begin will succeed as when
ext4_generic_write_inline_data calls ext4_prepare_inline_data, pos + len
will be truncated, leading to ext4_prepare_inline_data parameter to be 6
instead of 0x10000000006.

Then, later when write_end is called, we hit:

        BUG_ON(pos + len > EXT4_I(inode)->i_inline_size);

at ext4_write_inline_data.

Fix it by using a loff_t type for the len parameter in
ext4_prepare_inline_data instead of an unsigned int.

      <title>CVE-2025-38217 - Linux Kernel hwmon ftsteutates Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38217
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 45 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (ftsteutates) Fix TOCTOU race in fts_read()

In the fts_read() function, when handling hwmon_pwm_auto_channels_temp,
the code accesses the shared variable data->fan_source[channel] twice
without holding any locks. It is first checked against
FTS_FAN_SOURCE_INVALID, and if the check passes, it is read again
when used as an argument to the BIT() macro.

This creates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition.
Another thread executing fts_update_device() can modify the value of
data->fan_source[channel] between the check and its use. If the value
is changed to FTS_FAN_SOURCE_INVALID (0xff) during this window, the
BIT() macro will be called with a large shift value (BIT(255)).
A bit shift by a value greater than or equal to the type width is
undefined behavior and can lead to a crash or incorrect values being
returned to userspace.

Fix this by reading data->fan_source[channel] into a local variable
once, eliminating the race condition. Additionally, add a bounds check
to ensure the value is less than BITS_PER_LONG before passing it to
the BIT() macro, making the code more robust against undefined behavior.

This possible bug was found by an experimental static analysis tool
developed by our team.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to do sanity check on sit_bitmap_size

w/ below testcase, resize will generate a corrupted image which
contains inconsistent metadata, so when mounting such image, it
will trigger kernel panic:

touch img
truncate -s $((512*1024*1024*1024)) img
mkfs.f2fs -f img $((256*1024*1024))
resize.f2fs -s -i img -t $((1024*1024*1024))
mount img /mnt/f2fs

The reaseon is:

sit_i->bitmap_size is 192, so size of sit bitmap is 192*8=1536, at maximum
there are 1536 sit blocks, however MAIN_SEGS is 261893, so that sit_blk_cnt
is 4762, build_sit_entries() -> current_sit_addr() tries to access
out-of-boundary in sit_bitmap at offset from [1536, 4762), once sit_bitmap
and sit_bitmap_mirror is not the same, it will trigger f2fs_bug_on().

Let's add sanity check in f2fs_sanity_check_ckpt() to avoid panic.

      <title>CVE-2025-38220 - Linux Kernel ext4 NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38220
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 45 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: only dirty folios when data journaling regular files

fstest generic/388 occasionally reproduces a crash that looks as
follows:

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
...

 ...

This occurs when processing a symlink inode from the orphan list. The
partial block zeroing code in the truncate path calls
ext4_dirty_journalled_data() -> folio_mark_dirty(). The latter calls
mapping->a_ops->dirty_folio(), but symlink inodes are not assigned an
a_ops vector in ext4, hence the crash.

To avoid this problem, update the ext4_dirty_journalled_data() helper to
only mark the folio dirty on regular files (for which a_ops is
assigned). This also matches the journaling logic in the ext4_symlink()
creation path, where ext4_handle_dirty_metadata() is called directly.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: Fix do_register_framebuffer to prevent null-ptr-deref in fb_videomode_to_var

If fb_add_videomode() in do_register_framebuffer() fails to allocate
memory for fb_videomode, it will later lead to a null-ptr dereference in
fb_videomode_to_var(), as the fb_info is registered while not having the
mode in modelist that is expected to be there, i.e. the one that is
described in fb_info->var.

Even though fbcon_init() checks beforehand if fb_match_mode() in
var_to_display() fails, it can not prevent the panic because fbcon_init()
does not return error code. Considering this and the comment in the code
about fb_match_mode() returning NULL - "This should not happen" - it is
better to prevent registering the fb_info if its mode was not set
successfully. Also move fb_add_videomode() closer to the beginning of
do_register_framebuffer() to avoid having to do the cleanup on fail.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Restore context entry setup order for aliased devices

Commit 2031c469f816 ("iommu/vt-d: Add support for static identity domain")
changed the context entry setup during domain attachment from a
set-and-check policy to a clear-and-reset approach. This inadvertently
introduced a regression affecting PCI aliased devices behind PCIe-to-PCI
bridges.

Specifically, keyboard and touchpad stopped working on several Apple
Macbooks with below messages:

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sch_hfsc: make hfsc_qlen_notify() idempotent

hfsc_qlen_notify() is not idempotent either and not friendly
to its callers, like fq_codel_dequeue(). Let's make it idempotent
to ease qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() callers' life:

1. update_vf() decreases cl->cl_nactive, so we can check whether it is

      <title>CVE-2025-6740 - Contact Form 7 Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6740
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Contact Form 7 Database Addon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘tmpD’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

      <title>CVE-2025-7066 - Jirafeau MIME Type Bypass Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7066
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Jirafeau normally prevents browser preview for text files due to the possibility that for example SVG and HTML documents could be exploited for cross site scripting. This was done by storing the MIME type of a file and allowing only browser preview for MIME types beginning with image (except for image/svg+xml, see CVE-2022-30110 and CVE-2024-12326), video and audio. However, it was possible to bypass this check by sending a manipulated MIME type containing a comma and an other MIME type like text/html (for example image/png,text/html). Browsers see multiple MIME types and text/html would takes precedence, allowing a possible attacker to do a cross-site scripting attack. The check for MIME types was enhanced to prevent a browser preview when the stored MIME type contains a comma.

      <title>CVE-2025-38174 - "Thunderbolt: Double Dequeue Vulnerability"</title>

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38174
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 42 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thunderbolt: Do not double dequeue a configuration request

Some of our devices crash in tb_cfg_request_dequeue():

 general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdead000000000122

 CPU: 6 PID: 91007 Comm: kworker/6:2 Tainted: G U W 6.6.65
 RIP: 0010:tb_cfg_request_dequeue+0x2d/0xa0
 Call Trace:
 <TASK>

 kthread+0xed/0x110
 ret_from_fork+0x38/0x50
 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30

The circumstances are unclear, however, the theory is that
tb_cfg_request_work() can be scheduled twice for a request:
first time via frame.callback from ring_work() and second
time from tb_cfg_request().  Both times kworkers will execute
tb_cfg_request_dequeue(), which results in double list_del()
from the ctl->request_queue (the list poison deference hints
at it: 0xdead000000000122).

Do not dequeue requests that don't have TB_CFG_REQUEST_ACTIVE
bit set.

This 'stress-ng' workload causes the concurrent deletions from
'binder_devices' and so requires full-featured synchronization
to prevent list corruption.

I've found this issue independently but pretty sure that syzbot did
the same, so Reported-by: and Closes: should be applicable here as well.

      <title>CVE-2025-5372 - OpenSSL SSH Key Derivation Buffer Initialization Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-5372
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A flaw was found in libssh versions built with OpenSSL versions older than 3.0, specifically in the ssh_kdf() function responsible for key derivation. Due to inconsistent interpretation of return values where OpenSSL uses 0 to indicate failure and libssh uses 0 for success—the function may mistakenly return a success status even when key derivation fails. This results in uninitialized cryptographic key buffers being used in subsequent communication, potentially compromising SSH sessions' confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-5953
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The WP Human Resource Management plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization in the ajax_insert_employee() and update_empoyee() functions in versions 2.0.0 through 2.2.17.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-5322
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The VikRentCar Car Rental Management System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the do_updatecar and createcar functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server, which may make remote code execution possible.

      <title>CVE-2025-49005 - Next.js App Router/Cache Poisoning Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-49005
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. In Next.js App Router from 15.3.0 to before 15.3.3 and Vercel CLI from 41.4.1 to 42.2.0, a cache poisoning vulnerability was found. The issue allowed page requests for HTML content to return a React Server Component (RSC) payload instead under certain conditions. When deployed to Vercel, this would only impact the browser cache, and would not lead to the CDN being poisoned. When self-hosted and deployed externally, this could lead to cache poisoning if the CDN does not properly distinguish between RSC / HTML in the cache keys. This issue has been resolved in Next.js 15.3.3.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>DjVuLibre is a GPL implementation of DjVu, a web-centric format for distributing documents and images. Prior to version 3.5.29, the MMRDecoder::scanruns method is affected by an OOB-write vulnerability, because it does not check that the xr pointer stays within the bounds of the allocated buffer. This can lead to writes beyond the allocated memory, resulting in a heap corruption condition. An out-of-bounds read with pr is also possible for the same reason. This issue has been patched in version 3.5.29.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34061
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A backdoor in PHPStudy versions 2016 through 2018 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on affected installations. The backdoor listens for base64-encoded PHP payloads in the Accept-Charset HTTP header of incoming requests, decodes and executes the payload without proper validation. This leads to remote code execution as the web server user, compromising the affected system.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34082
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A command injection vulnerability exists in IGEL OS versions prior to 11.04.270 within the Secure Terminal and Secure Shadow services.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34086
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Bolt CMS versions 3.7.0 and earlier contain a chain of vulnerabilities that together allow an authenticated user to achieve remote code execution. A user with valid credentials can inject arbitrary PHP code into the displayname field of the user profile, which is rendered unsanitized in backend templates. The attacker can then list and rename cached session files via the /async/browse/cache/.sessions and /async/folder/rename endpoints. By renaming a .session file to a path under the publicly accessible /files/ directory with a .php extension, the attacker can turn the injected code into an executable web shell. Finally, the attacker triggers the payload via a crafted HTTP GET request to the rogue file.

NOTE: The vendor announced that Bolt 3 reached end-of-life after 31 December 2021.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34089
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in Remote for Mac, a macOS remote control utility developed by Aexol Studio, in versions up to and including 2025.7. When the application is configured with authentication disabled (i.e., the "Allow unknown devices" option is enabled), the /api/executeScript endpoint is exposed without access control. This allows unauthenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary AppleScript payloads via the X-Script HTTP header, resulting in code execution using do shell script. Successful exploitation grants attackers the ability to run arbitrary commands on the macOS host with the privileges of the Remote for Mac background process.

      <title>CVE-2025-49846 - Wire iOS Unauthenticated System Log Disclosure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-49846
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>wire-ios is an iOS client for the Wire secure messaging application. From Wire iOS 3.111.1 to before 3.124.1, messages that were visible in the view port have been logged to the iOS system logs in clear text. Wire application logs created and managed by the application itself were not affected, especially not the logs users can export and send to Wire support. The iOS logs can only be accessed if someone had (physical) access to the underlying unlocked device. The issue manifested itself by calling canOpenUrl() and passing an invalid URL object. When iOS then performs the check and fails, it logs the contents to the system log. This is not documented behaviour. Wire released an emergency fix with version 3.124.1. As a workaround, users can reset their iOS device to remove the offending logs. Since Wire cannot access or modify iOS system logs, there's no other workaround other than a reset.

      <title>CVE-2025-48939 - Tarteaucitron.js Script Element Property Clobbering Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48939
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>tarteaucitron.js is a compliant and accessible cookie banner. Prior to version 1.22.0, a vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js where document.currentScript was accessed without verifying that it referenced an actual <script> element. If an attacker injected an HTML element, it could clobber the document.currentScript property. This causes the script to resolve incorrectly to an element instead of the <script> tag, leading to unexpected behavior or failure to load the script path correctly. This issue arises because in some browser environments, named DOM elements become properties on the global document object. An attacker with control over the HTML could exploit this to change the CDN domain of tarteaucitron. This issue has been patched in version 1.22.0.

<p>Dans ce cadre, elles co-publient aujourd’hui un document conjoint sur la vérification d'identité à distance « Remote Identity Proofing for EUDI Wallet Onboarding : Strengthening Assurance Against Evolving Threats. », suite de la première publication sur le même sujet, mis en ligne en décembre 2023.</p>
<p>En effet, pour mieux répondre aux besoins du marché numérique et renforcer la souveraineté numérique européenne, le cadre réglementaire eIDAS 2 pour l’identification électronique et les services de confiance a été modernisé et adopté en février 2024. Le principal changement structurel apporté par eIDAS 2 repose sur l’introduction d’un European Digital Identity Wallet, portefeuille numérique européen, dont l’obtention peut s’appuyer sur une vérification d’identité à distance.</p>
<p>En cohérence avec ces nouvelles orientations réglementaires, cette seconde édition de ce document conjoint permet de mieux saisir l’engagement de l’ANSSI et du BSI à contribuer activement à l’appropriation du portefeuille numérique européen et à anticiper l’évolution de la menace relative à la vérification d’identité à distance.</p>
<p>La publication met en lumière les progrès réalisés, les défis à relever face aux potentielles attaques et la nécessité d’une approche globale paneuropéenne des tests, de la certification et de la normalisation afin de garantir sécurité, résilience et confiance.</p>

      <title>CVE-2025-43713 - ASNA Assist and ASNA Registrar Deserialization Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-43713

<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ASNA Assist and ASNA Registrar before 2025-03-31 allow deserialization attacks against .NET remoting. These are Windows system services that support license key management and deprecated Windows network authentication. The services are implemented with .NET remoting and can be exploited via well-known deserialization techniques inherent in the technology. Because the services run with SYSTEM-level rights, exploits can be crafted to achieve escalation of privilege and arbitrary code execution. This affects DataGate for SQL Server 17.0.36.0 and 16.0.89.0, DataGate Component Suite 17.0.36.0 and 16.0.89.0, DataGate Monitor 17.0.26.0 and 16.0.65.0, DataGate WebPak 17.0.37.0 and 16.0.90.0, Monarch for .NET 11.4.50.0 and 10.0.62.0, Encore RPG 4.1.36.0, Visual RPG .NET FW 17.0.37.0 and 16.0.90.0, Visual RPG .NET FW Windows Deployment 17.0.36.0 and 16.0.89.0, WingsRPG 11.0.38.0 and 10.0.95.0, Mobile RPG 11.0.35.0 and 10.0.94.0, Monarch Framework for .NET FW 11.0.36.0 and 10.0.89.0, Browser Terminal 17.0.37.0 and 16.0.90.0, Visual RPG Classic 5.2.7.0 and 5.1.17.0, Visual RPG Deployment 5.2.7.0 and 5.1.17.0, and DataGate Studio 17.0.38.0 and 16.0.104.0.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 54 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The VNC authentication mechanism bases on a challenge-response system where both server and client use the same password for encryption. The challenge is sent from the server to the client, is encrypted by the client and sent back. The server does the same encryption locally and if the responses match it is prooven that the client knows the correct password. Since all VNC communication is unencrypted, an attacker can obtain the challenge and response and try to derive the password from this information.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-5647
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Multiple plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's bundled Magnific Popups library (version 1.1.0) in various versions due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

      <title>CVE-2025-38151 - Linux Kernel RDMA cma: Work Queue Corruption Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38151
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/cma: Fix hang when cma_netevent_callback fails to queue_work

The cited commit fixed a crash when cma_netevent_callback was called for
a cma_id while work on that id from a previous call had not yet started.
The work item was re-initialized in the second call, which corrupted the
work item currently in the work queue.

However, it left a problem when queue_work fails (because the item is
still pending in the work queue from a previous call). In this case,
cma_id_put (which is called in the work handler) is therefore not
called. This results in a userspace process hang (zombie process).

Fix this by calling cma_id_put() if queue_work fails.

      <title>CVE-2025-38153 - Allegro USB Network AQC111 Uninitialized Memory Access Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38153
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: aqc111: fix error handling of usbnet read calls

Syzkaller, courtesy of syzbot, identified an error (see report [1]) in
aqc111 driver, caused by incomplete sanitation of usb read calls'
results. This problem is quite similar to the one fixed in commit
920a9fa27e78 ("net: asix: add proper error handling of usb read errors").

For instance, usbnet_read_cmd() may read fewer than 'size' bytes,
even if the caller expected the full amount, and aqc111_read_cmd()
will not check its result properly. As [1] shows, this may lead
to MAC address in aqc111_bind() being only partly initialized,
triggering KMSAN warnings.

Fix the issue by verifying that the number of bytes read is
as expected and not less.

      <title>CVE-2025-38154 - Linux Kernel BPF Sockmap Use After Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38154
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, sockmap: Avoid using sk_socket after free when sending

The sk->sk_socket is not locked or referenced in backlog thread, and
during the call to skb_send_sock(), there is a race condition with
the release of sk_socket. All types of sockets(tcp/udp/unix/vsock)
will be affected.

Race conditions:
'''
CPU0                               CPU1

backlog::skb_send_sock
  sendmsg_unlocked
    sock_sendmsg
      sock_sendmsg_nosec
                                   close(fd):
                                     ...
                                     ops->release() -> sock_map_close()
                                     sk_socket->ops = NULL
                                     free(socket)
      sock->ops->sendmsg
            ^
            panic here
'''

The ref of psock become 0 after sock_map_close() executed.
'''
void sock_map_close()
{
    ...
    if (likely(psock)) {
    ...
    // !! here we remove psock and the ref of psock become 0
    sock_map_remove_links(sk, psock)
    psock = sk_psock_get(sk);
    if (unlikely(!psock))
        goto no_psock; <=== Control jumps here via goto
        ...
        cancel_delayed_work_sync(&psock->work); <=== not executed
        sk_psock_put(sk, psock);
        ...
}
'''

Based on the fact that we already wait for the workqueue to finish in
sock_map_close() if psock is held, we simply increase the psock
reference count to avoid race conditions.

With this patch, if the backlog thread is running, sock_map_close() will
wait for the backlog thread to complete and cancel all pending work.

If no backlog running, any pending work that hasn't started by then will
fail when invoked by sk_psock_get(), as the psock reference count have
been zeroed, and sk_psock_drop() will cancel all jobs via
cancel_delayed_work_sync().

In summary, we require synchronization to coordinate the backlog thread
and close() thread.

The panic I catched:
'''

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38158
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hisi_acc_vfio_pci: fix XQE dma address error

The dma addresses of EQE and AEQE are wrong after migration and
results in guest kernel-mode encryption services  failure.
Comparing the definition of hardware registers, we found that
there was an error when the data read from the register was
combined into an address. Therefore, the address combination
sequence needs to be corrected.

Even after fixing the above problem, we still have an issue
where the Guest from an old kernel can get migrated to
new kernel and may result in wrong data.

In order to ensure that the address is correct after migration,
if an old magic number is detected, the dma address needs to be
updated.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38159
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtw88: fix the 'para' buffer size to avoid reading out of bounds

Set the size to 6 instead of 2, since 'para' array is passed to
'rtw_fw_bt_wifi_control(rtwdev, para[0], &para[1])', which reads
5 bytes:

void rtw_fw_bt_wifi_control(struct rtw_dev *rtwdev, u8 op_code, u8 *data)
{
    ...
    SET_BT_WIFI_CONTROL_DATA1(h2c_pkt, *data);
    SET_BT_WIFI_CONTROL_DATA2(h2c_pkt, *(data + 1));
    ...
    SET_BT_WIFI_CONTROL_DATA5(h2c_pkt, *(data + 4));

Detected using the static analysis tool - Svace.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/mlx5: Fix error flow upon firmware failure for RQ destruction

Upon RQ destruction if the firmware command fails which is the
last resource to be destroyed some SW resources were already cleaned
regardless of the failure.

Now properly rollback the object to its original state upon such failure.

In order to avoid a use-after free in case someone tries to destroy the
object again, which results in the following kernel trace:

      <title>CVE-2025-38162 - Linux Kernel Netfilter NFT Set Pipapo Integer Overflow Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38162
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: prevent overflow in lookup table allocation

When calculating the lookup table size, ensure the following
multiplication does not overflow:

- desc->field_len[] maximum value is U8_MAX multiplied by
  NFT_PIPAPO_GROUPS_PER_BYTE(f) that can be 2, worst case.
- NFT_PIPAPO_BUCKETS(f->bb) is 2^8, worst case.
- sizeof(unsigned long), from sizeof(*f->lt), lt in
  struct nft_pipapo_field.

Then, use check_mul_overflow() to multiply by bucket size and then use
check_add_overflow() to the alignment for avx2 (if needed). Finally, add
lt_size_check_overflow() helper and use it to consolidate this.

While at it, replace leftover allocation using the GFP_KERNEL to
GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT for consistency, in pipapo_resize().

In this patch, we add a condition in f2fs_gc_range() to check whether
section is opened or not, and skip block migration for opened section.

The panic originates from the assertion BUG_ON(skb_shared(skb)) in
skb_linearize(). A previous commit(see Fixes tag) introduced skb_get()
to avoid race conditions between skb operations in the backlog and skb
release in the recvmsg path. However, this caused the panic to always
occur when skb_linearize is executed.

The "--rx-strp 100000" parameter forces the RX path to use the strparser
module which aggregates data until it reaches 100KB before calling sockmap
logic. The 100KB payload exceeds MAX_MSG_FRAGS, triggering skb_linearize.

To fix this issue, just move skb_get into sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue.

After calling bpf_exec_tx_verdict(), the size of msg_pl->sg may increase,
e.g., when the BPF program executes bpf_msg_push_data().

If the BPF program sets cork_bytes and sg.size is smaller than cork_bytes,
it will return -ENOSPC and attempt to roll back to the non-zero copy
logic. However, during rollback, msg->msg_iter is reset, but since
msg_pl->sg.size has been increased, subsequent executions will exceed the
actual size of msg_iter.
'''
iov_iter_revert(&msg->msg_iter, msg_pl->sg.size - orig_size);
'''

The changes in this commit are based on the following considerations:

1. When cork_bytes is set, rolling back to non-zero copy logic is
pointless and can directly go to zero-copy logic.

2. We can not calculate the correct number of bytes to revert msg_iter.

Assume the original data is "abcdefgh" (8 bytes), and after 3 pushes
by the BPF program, it becomes 11-byte data: "abc?de?fgh?".
Then, we set cork_bytes to 6, which means the first 6 bytes have been
processed, and the remaining 5 bytes "?fgh?" will be cached until the
length meets the cork_bytes requirement.

However, some data in "?fgh?" is not within 'sg->msg_iter'
(but in msg_pl instead), especially the data "?" we pushed.

So it doesn't seem as simple as just reverting through an offset of
msg_iter.

3. For non-TLS sockets in tcp_bpf_sendmsg, when a "cork" situation occurs,
the user-space send() doesn't return an error, and the returned length is
the same as the input length parameter, even if some data is cached.

Additionally, I saw that the current non-zero-copy logic for handling
corking is written as:
'''
line 1177
else if (ret != -EAGAIN) {
	if (ret == -ENOSPC)
		ret = 0;
	goto send_end;
'''

So it's ok to just return 'copied' without error when a "cork" situation
occurs.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: handle hdr_first_de() return value

The hdr_first_de() function returns a pointer to a struct NTFS_DE. This
pointer may be NULL. To handle the NULL error effectively, it is important
to implement an error handler. This will help manage potential errors
consistently.

Additionally, error handling for the return value already exists at other
points where this function is called.

      <title>CVE-2025-38169 - Linux Kernel ARM64 FPSIMD State Clobbering Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38169
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/fpsimd: Avoid clobbering kernel FPSIMD state with SMSTOP

On system with SME, a thread's kernel FPSIMD state may be erroneously
clobbered during a context switch immediately after that state is
restored. Systems without SME are unaffected.

If the CPU happens to be in streaming SVE mode before a context switch
to a thread with kernel FPSIMD state, fpsimd_thread_switch() will
restore the kernel FPSIMD state using fpsimd_load_kernel_state() while
the CPU is still in streaming SVE mode. When fpsimd_thread_switch()
subsequently calls fpsimd_flush_cpu_state(), this will execute an
SMSTOP, causing an exit from streaming SVE mode. The exit from
streaming SVE mode will cause the hardware to reset a number of
FPSIMD/SVE/SME registers, clobbering the FPSIMD state.

Fix this by calling fpsimd_flush_cpu_state() before restoring the kernel
FPSIMD state.

      <title>CVE-2025-38170 - Linux kernel - arm64 FPSIMD SME Trap Handling Stale CPU State Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38170
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/fpsimd: Discard stale CPU state when handling SME traps

The logic for handling SME traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SME set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SME traps enabled). This can result in warnings from
do_sme_acc() where SME traps are not expected while TIF_SME is set:

|        /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */
|        if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))
|                WARN_ON(1);

This is very similar to the SVE issue we fixed in commit:

  751ecf6afd6568ad ("arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps")

The race can occur when the SME trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sme_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SME clear, SME traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))
|                 WARN_ON(1);
|
|         if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                 unsigned long vq_minus_one =
|                         sve_vq_from_vl(task_get_sme_vl(current)) - 1;
|                 sme_set_vq(vq_minus_one);
|
|                 fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu();
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SME traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.

      <title>CVE-2025-38172 - "Linux EROFS UAF Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38172
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: avoid using multiple devices with different type

For multiple devices, both primary and extra devices should be the
same type. `erofs_init_device` has already guaranteed that if the
primary is a file-backed device, extra devices should also be
regular files.

However, if the primary is a block device while the extra device
is a file-backed device, `erofs_init_device` will get an ENOTBLK,
which is not treated as an error in `erofs_fc_get_tree`, and that
leads to an UAF:

  erofs_fc_get_tree
    get_tree_bdev_flags(erofs_fc_fill_super)
      erofs_read_superblock
        erofs_init_device  // sbi->dif0 is not inited yet,
                           // return -ENOTBLK
      deactivate_locked_super
        free(sbi)
    if (err is -ENOTBLK)
      sbi->dif0.file = filp_open()  // sbi UAF

So if -ENOTBLK is hitted in `erofs_init_device`, it means the
primary device must be a block device, and the extra device
is not a block device. The error can be converted to -EINVAL.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38149
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 53 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: clear phydev->devlink when the link is deleted

There is a potential crash issue when disabling and re-enabling the
network port. When disabling the network port, phy_detach() calls
device_link_del() to remove the device link, but it does not clear
phydev->devlink, so phydev->devlink is not a NULL pointer. Then the
network port is re-enabled, but if phy_attach_direct() fails before
calling device_link_add(), the code jumps to the "error" label and
calls phy_detach(). Since phydev->devlink retains the old value from
the previous attach/detach cycle, device_link_del() uses the old value,
which accesses a NULL pointer and causes a crash. The simplified crash
log is as follows.

[   24.702421] Call trace:
[   24.704856]  device_link_put_kref+0x20/0x120
[   24.709124]  device_link_del+0x30/0x48

[   24.725140]  phylink_of_phy_connect+0x1c/0x34

Therefore, phydev->devlink needs to be cleared when the device link is
deleted.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34074
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in Lucee’s administrative interface due to insecure design in the scheduled task functionality. An administrator with access to /lucee/admin/web.cfm can configure a scheduled job to retrieve a remote .cfm file from an attacker-controlled server, which is written to the Lucee webroot and executed with the privileges of the Lucee service account. Because Lucee does not enforce integrity checks, path restrictions, or execution controls for scheduled task fetches, this feature can be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution. This issue is distinct from CVE-2024-55354.

      <title>CVE-2025-34075 - Vagrant Virtual Machine Escape via Ruby Code Injection</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34075
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated virtual machine escape vulnerability exists in HashiCorp Vagrant when using the default synced folder configuration. By design, Vagrant automatically mounts the host system’s project directory into the guest VM under /vagrant (or C:\vagrant on Windows). This includes the Vagrantfile configuration file, which is a Ruby script evaluated by the host every time a vagrant command is executed in the project directory. If a low-privileged attacker obtains shell access to the guest VM, they can append arbitrary Ruby code to the mounted Vagrantfile. When a user on the host later runs any vagrant command, the injected code is executed on the host with that user’s privileges.

 While this shared-folder behavior is well-documented by Vagrant, the security implications of Vagrantfile execution from guest-writable storage are not explicitly addressed. This effectively enables guest-to-host code execution in multi-tenant or adversarial VM scenarios.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34076
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated local file inclusion vulnerability exists in Microweber CMS versions <= 1.2.11 through misuse of the backup management API. Authenticated users can abuse the /api/BackupV2/upload and /api/BackupV2/download endpoints to read arbitrary files from the underlying filesystem. By specifying an absolute file path in the src parameter of the upload request, the server may relocate or delete the target file depending on the web service user’s privileges. The corresponding download endpoint can then be used to retrieve the file contents, effectively enabling local file disclosure. This behavior stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied paths and inadequate restrictions on file access and backup logic.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in NSClient++ 0.5.2.35 when both the web interface and ExternalScripts features are enabled. The configuration file (nsclient.ini) stores the administrative password in plaintext and is readable by local users. By extracting this password, an attacker can authenticate to the NSClient++ web interface (typically accessible on port 8443) and abuse the ExternalScripts plugin to inject and execute arbitrary commands as SYSTEM by registering a custom script, saving the configuration, and triggering it via the API.

This behavior is documented but insecure, as the plaintext credential exposure undermines access isolation between local users and administrative functions.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in NSClient++ version 0.5.2.35 when the web interface and ExternalScripts module are enabled. A remote attacker with the administrator password can authenticate to the web interface (default port 8443), inject arbitrary commands as external scripts via the /settings/query.json API, save the configuration, and trigger the script via the /query/{name} endpoint. The injected commands are executed with SYSTEM privileges, enabling full remote compromise.

This capability is an intended feature, but the lack of safeguards or privilege separation makes it risky when exposed to untrusted actors.

      <title>CVE-2025-34090 - "Google Chrome AppBound Cookie Encryption Bypass"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34090
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A security bypass vulnerability exists in Google Chrome AppBound cookie encryption mechanism due to insufficient validation of COM server paths during inter-process communication. A local low-privileged attacker can hijack the COM class identifier (CLSID) registration used by Chrome's elevation service and point it to a non-existent or malicious binary. When this hijack occurs, Chrome silently falls back to the legacy cookie encryption mechanism (protected only by user-DPAPI), thereby enabling cookie decryption by any user-context malware without SYSTEM-level access. This flaw bypasses the protections intended by the AppBound encryption design and allows cookie theft from Chromium-based browsers.

Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.

      <title>CVE-2025-34091 - Google Chrome AppBound Encryption Padding Oracle</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34091
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A padding oracle vulnerability exists in Google Chrome’s AppBound cookie encryption mechanism due to observable decryption failure behavior in Windows Event Logs when handling malformed ciphertext in SYSTEM-DPAPI-encrypted blobs. A local attacker can repeatedly send malformed ciphertexts to the Chrome elevation service and distinguish between padding and MAC errors, enabling a padding oracle attack. This allows partial decryption of the SYSTEM-DPAPI layer and eventual recovery of the user-DPAPI encrypted cookie key, which is trivially decrypted by the attacker’s own context. This issue undermines the core purpose of AppBound Encryption by enabling low-privileged cookie theft through cryptographic misuse and verbose error feedback.

Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.

This behavior arises from a combination of Chrome’s AppBound implementation and the way Microsoft Windows DPAPI reports decryption failures via Event Logs. As such, the vulnerability relies on cryptographic behavior and error visibility in all supported versions of Windows.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34092
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A cookie encryption bypass vulnerability exists in Google Chrome’s AppBound mechanism due to weak path validation logic within the elevation service. When Chrome encrypts a cookie key, it records its own executable path as validation metadata. Later, when decrypting, the elevation service compares the requesting process’s path to this stored path. However, due to path canonicalization inconsistencies, an attacker can impersonate Chrome (e.g., by naming their binary chrome.exe and placing it in a similar path) and successfully retrieve the encrypted cookie key. This allows malicious processes to retrieve cookies intended to be restricted to the Chrome process only.

Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 15 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>kotaemon is an open-source RAG-based tool for document comprehension. From versions 0.10.6 and prior, in libs/ktem/ktem/index/file/ui.py, the index_fn method accepts both URLs and local file paths without validation. The pipeline streams these paths directly and stores them, enabling attackers to traverse directories (e.g. ../../../../../.env) and exfiltrate sensitive files. This issue has been patched via commit 37cdc28, in version 0.10.7 which has not been made public at time of publication.

      <title>CVE-2025-53359 - Ethereum Crate Signature Malleability Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53359
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 15 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ethereum is a common ethereum structs for Rust. Prior to ethereum crate v0.18.0, signature malleability (according to EIP-2) was only checked for "legacy" transactions, but not for EIP-2930, EIP-1559 and EIP-7702 transactions. This is a specification deviation. The signature malleability itself is not a security issue and not as high of a risk if the ethereum crate is used on a single-implementation blockchain. This issue has been patched in version v0.18.0. A workaround for this issue involves manually checking transaction malleability outside of the crate, however upgrading is recommended.

      <title>CVE-2025-53106 - Graylog API Token Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53106
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 53 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Graylog is a free and open log management platform. In versions 6.2.0 to before 6.2.4 and 6.3.0-alpha.1 to before 6.3.0-rc.2, Graylog users can gain elevated privileges by creating and using API tokens for the local Administrator or any other user for whom the malicious user knows the ID. For the attack to succeed, the attacker needs a user account in Graylog. They can then proceed to issue hand-crafted requests to the Graylog REST API and exploit a weak permission check for token creation. This issue has been patched in versions 6.2.4 and 6.3.0-rc.2. A workaround involves disabling the respective configuration found in System > Configuration > Users > "Allow users to create personal access tokens".

      <title>CVE-2025-34072 - "Anthropic Slack MCP Server Data Exfiltration Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34072
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A data exfiltration vulnerability exists in Anthropic’s deprecated Slack Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server via automatic link unfurling. When an AI agent using the Slack MCP Server processes untrusted data, it can be manipulated to generate messages containing attacker-crafted hyperlinks embedding sensitive data. Slack’s link preview bots (e.g., Slack-LinkExpanding, Slackbot, Slack-ImgProxy) will then issue outbound requests to the attacker-controlled URL, resulting in zero-click exfiltration of private data.

      <title>CVE-2025-34073 - Maltrail Command Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34073
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unauthenticated command injection vulnerability exists in stamparm/maltrail (Maltrail) versions <=0.54. A remote attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands via the username parameter in a POST request to the /login endpoint. This occurs due to unsafe handling of user-supplied input passed to subprocess.check_output() in core/http.py, allowing injection of shell metacharacters. Exploitation does not require authentication and commands are executed with the privileges of the Maltrail process.

      <title>CVE-2025-49588 - Linkwarden File Path Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-49588
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Linkwarden is a self-hosted, open-source collaborative bookmark manager to collect, organize and archive webpages.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-27026
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A missing double-check feature in the WebGUI for CLI deactivation in Infinera G42 
version R6.1.3 allows an authenticated administrator to make other 
management interfaces unavailable via local and network interfaces. The CLI deactivation via the WebGUI does not only stop CLI interface but deactivates also Linux Shell, WebGUI and Physical Serial Console access. No 
confirmation is asked at deactivation time. Loosing access to these services device administrators are at risk of completely loosing device control.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34069
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in GFI Kerio Control 9.4.5 due to insecure default proxy configuration and weak access control in the GFIAgent service. The non-transparent proxy on TCP port 3128 can be used to forward unauthenticated requests to internal services such as GFIAgent, bypassing firewall restrictions and exposing internal management endpoints. This enables unauthenticated attackers to access the GFIAgent service on ports 7995 and 7996, retrieve the appliance UUID, and issue administrative requests via the proxy. Exploitation results in full administrative access to the Kerio Control appliance.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34070
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A missing authentication vulnerability in the GFIAgent component of GFI Kerio Control 9.4.5 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform privileged operations. The GFIAgent service, responsible for integration with GFI AppManager, exposes HTTP services on ports 7995 and 7996 without proper authentication. The /proxy handler on port 7996 allows arbitrary forwarding to administrative endpoints when provided with an Appliance UUID, which itself can be retrieved from port 7995. This results in a complete authentication bypass, permitting access to sensitive administrative APIs.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-27023
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Lack or insufficent input validation in WebGUI CLI web in Infinera G42 
version R6.1.3 allows remote authenticated users to read all OS files 
via crafted CLI commands.


Details: The web interface based management of the Infinera G42 appliance enables the feature of
 executing a restricted set of commands. This feature 
also offers the option to execute a script-file already present on the target
 device. When a non-script or incorrect file is specified, the content 
of the file is shown along with an error message. Due to an execution of the http service with a privileged user all files on the file system can be viewed this way.

write files on the target device file system. Files are written as root.
 Using Postman it is possible to perform a Directory Traversal attack 
and write files into any location of the device file system. Similarly to the PUT method, it is possible to leverage the 
same mechanism to read any file from the file system by using the GET 
method.

      <title>CVE-2025-24332 - Nokia Single RAN AirScale Baseband SSH Privilege Escalation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-24332
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 6 hours, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Nokia Single RAN AirScale baseband allows an authenticated administrative user access to all physical boards after performing a single login to the baseband system board. The baseband does not re-authenticate the user when they connect from the baseband system board to the baseband capacity boards using the internal bsoc SSH service, which is available only internally within the baseband and through the internal backplane between the boards. The bsoc SSH allows login from one board to another via the baseband internal backplane using an SSH private key present on the baseband system board.

This bsoc SSH capability was previously considered an administrative functionality but has now been restricted to be available only to baseband root-privileged administrators. This restriction mitigates the possibility of misuse with lower-level privileges (e.g., from baseband software images). This mitigation is included starting from release 23R4-SR 3.0 MP and later

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-24331
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Single RAN baseband OAM service is intended to run as an unprivileged service. However, it initially starts with root privileges and assigns certain capabilities before dropping to an unprivileged level. The capabilities retained from the root period are considered extensive after the privilege drop and, in theory, could potentially allow actions beyond the intended scope of the OAM service. These actions could include gaining root privileges, accessing root-owned files, modifying them as the file owner, and then returning them to root ownership. This issue has been corrected starting from release 24R1-SR 0.2 MP and later.

Beginning with release 24R1-SR 0.2 MP, the OAM service software capabilities are restricted to the minimum necessary.

      <title>CVE-2025-6464 - Forminator Forms Unauthenticated PHP Object Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6464
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 7 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Forminator Forms – Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.44.2 via deserialization of untrusted input in the 'entry_delete_upload_files' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object through a PHAR file. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. Deserialization occurs when the form submission is deleted, whether by an Administrator or via auto-deletion determined by plugin settings.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-5692
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 6 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Lead Form Data Collection to CRM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the doFieldAjaxAction() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.

      <title>CVE-2024-46993 - Electron Heap Buffer Overflow</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-46993
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 1, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 10 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Electron is an open source framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In versions prior to 28.3.2, 29.3.3, and 30.0.3, the nativeImage.createFromPath() and nativeImage.createFromBuffer() functions call a function downstream that is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. An Electron program that uses either of the affected functions is vulnerable to a buffer overflow if an attacker is in control of the image's height, width, and contents. This issue has been patched in versions  28.3.2, 29.3.3, and 30.0.3. There are no workarounds for this issue.

      <title>CVE-2024-49364 - Tiny-SECP256k1 Buffer Package Private Key Extraction Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-49364
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 1, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 10 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>tiny-secp256k1 is a tiny secp256k1 native/JS wrapper. Prior to version 1.1.7, a private key can be extracted on signing a malicious JSON-stringifiable object, when global Buffer is the buffer package. This affects only environments where require('buffer') is the NPM buffer package. The Buffer.isBuffer check can be bypassed, resulting in k reuse for different messages, leading to private key extraction over a single invalid message (and a second one for which any message/signature could be taken, e.g. previously known valid one). This issue has been patched in version 1.1.7.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 1, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 10 hours, 47 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>tiny-secp256k1 is a tiny secp256k1 native/JS wrapper. Prior to version 1.1.7, a malicious JSON-stringifyable message can be made passing on verify(), when global Buffer is the buffer package. This affects only environments where require('buffer') is the NPM buffer package. Buffer.isBuffer check can be bypassed, resulting in strange objects being accepted as a message, and those messages could trick verify() into returning false-positive true values. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.7.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-46992
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 1, 2025, 2:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 47 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Electron is an open source framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. From versions 30.0.0-alpha.1 to before 30.0.5 and 31.0.0-alpha.1 to before 31.0.0-beta.1, Electron is vulnerable to an ASAR Integrity bypass. This only impacts apps that have the embeddedAsarIntegrityValidation and onlyLoadAppFromAsar fuses enabled. Apps without these fuses enabled are not impacted. This issue is specific to Windows, apps using these fuses on macOS are not impacted. Specifically this issue can only be exploited if the app is launched from a filesystem the attacker has write access too. i.e. the ability to edit files inside the .app bundle on macOS which these fuses are supposed to protect against. This issue has been patched in versions 30.0.5 and 31.0.0-beta.1. There are no workarounds for this issue.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53095
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 1, 2025, 2:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 47 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Sunshine is a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight. Prior to version 2025.628.4510, the web UI of Sunshine lacks protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious web page that, when visited by an authenticated user, can trigger unintended actions within the Sunshine application on behalf of that user. Specifically, since the application does OS command execution by design, this issue can be exploited to abuse the "Command Preparations" feature, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed with Administrator privileges when an application is launched. This issue has been patched in version 2025.628.4510.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 25 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. Prior to version 2.33.9, access tokens are used as GET parameters. The JSON Web Token (JWT) which is used as a session identifier will get leaked to anyone having access to the URLs accessed by the user. This will give an attacker full access to a user's account and, in consequence, to all sensitive files the user has access to. This issue has been patched in version 2.33.9.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 25 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. Prior to version 2.33.10, the implementation of the allowlist is erroneous, allowing a user to execute more shell commands than they are authorized for. The concrete impact of this vulnerability depends on the commands configured, and the binaries installed on the server or in the container image. Due to the missing separation of scopes on the OS-level, this could give an attacker access to all files managed the application, including the File Browser database. This issue has been patched in version 2.33.10.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. In versions 2.32.0 and prior, the implementation of password protected links is error-prone, resulting in potential unprotected sharing of a file through a direct download link.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-40710
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Host Header Injection (HHI) vulnerability in the Hotspot Shield VPN client, which can induce unexpected behaviour when accessing third-party web applications through the VPN tunnel. Although such applications do not present this vulnerability per se, the use of the tunnel, together with a forged Host header, can cause the VPN client to redirect or forward HTTP requests to servers other than those originally intended, leading to consequences such as open redirects or delivery of traffic to infrastructure controlled by an attacker. This does not imply a flaw in the target applications, but in how the VPN client internally handles outgoing headers and requests.

      <title>CVE-2025-38090 - Linux Kernel Rapidio Heap Overwrite Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38090
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 6 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers/rapidio/rio_cm.c: prevent possible heap overwrite

In

riocm_cdev_ioctl(RIO_CM_CHAN_SEND)
   -> cm_chan_msg_send()
      -> riocm_ch_send()

cm_chan_msg_send() checks that userspace didn't send too much data but
riocm_ch_send() failed to check that userspace sent sufficient data.  The
result is that riocm_ch_send() can write to fields in the rio_ch_chan_hdr
which were outside the bounds of the space which cm_chan_msg_send()
allocated.

Address this by teaching riocm_ch_send() to check that the entire
rio_ch_chan_hdr was copied in from userspace.

      <title>CVE-2025-38089 - SunRPC Authentication Error Handling Remote Crash Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38089
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sunrpc: handle SVC_GARBAGE during svc auth processing as auth error

tianshuo han reported a remotely-triggerable crash if the client sends a
kernel RPC server a specially crafted packet. If decoding the RPC reply
fails in such a way that SVC_GARBAGE is returned without setting the
rq_accept_statp pointer, then that pointer can be dereferenced and a
value stored there.

If it's the first time the thread has processed an RPC, then that
pointer will be set to NULL and the kernel will crash. In other cases,
it could create a memory scribble.

The server sunrpc code treats a SVC_GARBAGE return from svc_authenticate
or pg_authenticate as if it should send a GARBAGE_ARGS reply. RFC 5531
says that if authentication fails that the RPC should be rejected
instead with a status of AUTH_ERR.

Handle a SVC_GARBAGE return as an AUTH_ERROR, with a reason of
AUTH_BADCRED instead of returning GARBAGE_ARGS in that case. This
sidesteps the whole problem of touching the rpc_accept_statp pointer in
this situation and avoids the crash.

      <title>CVE-2025-38087 - Linux Kernel Taprio Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38087
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: fix use-after-free in taprio_dev_notifier

Since taprio’s taprio_dev_notifier() isn’t protected by an
RCU read-side critical section, a race with advance_sched()
can lead to a use-after-free.

Adding rcu_read_lock() inside taprio_dev_notifier() prevents this.

      <title>CVE-2025-38086 - "NetChip Ch9200 Uninitialized Memory Access Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38086
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 28, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 12 hours, 24 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ch9200: fix uninitialised access during mii_nway_restart

In mii_nway_restart() the code attempts to call
mii->mdio_read which is ch9200_mdio_read(). ch9200_mdio_read()
utilises a local buffer called "buff", which is initialised
with control_read(). However "buff" is conditionally
initialised inside control_read():

        if (err == size) {
                memcpy(data, buf, size);
        }

If the condition of "err == size" is not met, then
"buff" remains uninitialised. Once this happens the
uninitialised "buff" is accessed and returned during
ch9200_mdio_read():

        return (buff[0] | buff[1] << 8);

The problem stems from the fact that ch9200_mdio_read()
ignores the return value of control_read(), leading to
uinit-access of "buff".

To fix this we should check the return value of
control_read() and return early on error.

      <title>CVE-2025-38084 - Linux Kernel Hugetlb Racy Protection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38084
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 28, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 11 hours, 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb: unshare page tables during VMA split, not before

Currently, __split_vma() triggers hugetlb page table unsharing through
vm_ops->may_split().  This happens before the VMA lock and rmap locks are
taken - which is too early, it allows racing VMA-locked page faults in our
process and racing rmap walks from other processes to cause page tables to
be shared again before we actually perform the split.

Fix it by explicitly calling into the hugetlb unshare logic from
__split_vma() in the same place where THP splitting also happens.  At that
point, both the VMA and the rmap(s) are write-locked.

An annoying detail is that we can now call into the helper
hugetlb_unshare_pmds() from two different locking contexts:

1. from hugetlb_split(), holding:
    - mmap lock (exclusively)
    - VMA lock
    - file rmap lock (exclusively)
2. hugetlb_unshare_all_pmds(), which I think is designed to be able to
   call us with only the mmap lock held (in shared mode), but currently
   only runs while holding mmap lock (exclusively) and VMA lock

Backporting note:
This commit fixes a racy protection that was introduced in commit
b30c14cd6102 ("hugetlb: unshare some PMDs when splitting VMAs"); that
commit claimed to fix an issue introduced in 5.13, but it should actually
also go all the way back.

      <title>CVE-2025-38085 - Linux Kernel: Huge Page Table Unshare Race Condition Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38085
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 28, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 11 hours, 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb: fix huge_pmd_unshare() vs GUP-fast race

huge_pmd_unshare() drops a reference on a page table that may have
previously been shared across processes, potentially turning it into a
normal page table used in another process in which unrelated VMAs can
afterwards be installed.

If this happens in the middle of a concurrent gup_fast(), gup_fast() could
end up walking the page tables of another process.  While I don't see any
way in which that immediately leads to kernel memory corruption, it is
really weird and unexpected.

Fix it with an explicit broadcast IPI through tlb_remove_table_sync_one(),
just like we do in khugepaged when removing page tables for a THP
collapse.

      <title>CVE-2025-53097 - Roo Code Schema Fetching File Read and Write Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53097
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 27, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 36 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent. Prior to version 3.20.3, there was an issue where the Roo Code agent's `search_files` tool did not respect the setting to disable reads outside of the VS Code workspace. This means that an attacker who was able to inject a prompt into the agent could potentially read a sensitive file and then write the information to a JSON schema. Users have the option to disable schema fetching in VS Code, but the feature is enabled by default. For users with this feature enabled, writing to the schema would trigger a network request without the user having a chance to deny. This issue is of moderate severity, since it requires the attacker to already be able to submit prompts to the agent. Version 3.20.3 fixed the issue where `search_files` did not respect the setting to limit it to the workspace. This reduces the scope of the damage if an attacker is able to take control of the agent through prompt injection or another vector.

      <title>CVE-2025-53098 - Roo Code MCP Configuration Command Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53098
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 27, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 36 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent. The project-specific MCP configuration for the Roo Code agent is stored in the `.roo/mcp.json` file within the VS Code workspace. Because the MCP configuration format allows for execution of arbitrary commands, prior to version 3.20.3, it would have been possible for an attacker with access to craft a prompt to ask the agent to write a malicious command to the MCP configuration file. If the user had opted-in to auto-approving file writes within the project, this would have led to arbitrary command execution. This issue is of moderate severity, since it requires the attacker to already be able to submit prompts to the agent (for instance through a prompt injection attack), for the user to have MCP enabled (on by default), and for the user to have enabled auto-approved file writes (off by default). Version 3.20.3 fixes the issue by adding an additional layer of opt-in configuration for auto-approving writing to Roo's configuration files, including all files within the `.roo/` folder.

<strong>Published : </strong> June 27, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 8 hours, 1 minute ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ESPAsyncWebServer is an asynchronous HTTP and WebSocket server library for ESP32, ESP8266, RP2040 and RP2350. In versions up to and including 3.7.8, a CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) injection vulnerability exists in the construction and output of HTTP headers within `AsyncWebHeader.cpp`. Unsanitized input allows attackers to inject CR (`\r`) or LF (`\n`) characters into header names or values, leading to arbitrary header or response manipulation. Manipulation of HTTP headers and responses can enable a wide range of attacks, making the severity of this vulnerability high. A fix is available at pull request 211 and is expected to be part of version 3.7.9.

When, for example, using RAC during a screenshare, a malicious user could access the same session by copying the URL from the shown browser. authentik 2025.4.3 and 2025.6.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, it is recommended to decrease the duration a token is valid for (in the RAC Provider settings, set Connection expiry to `minutes=5` for example). The maintainers of authentik also recommend enabling the option Delete authorization on disconnect.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53018
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 27, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 36 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Lychee is a free, open-source photo-management tool. Prior to version 6.6.13, a critical Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `/api/v2/Photo::fromUrl` endpoint. This flaw lets an attacker instruct the application’s backend to make HTTP requests to any URL they choose. Consequently, internal network resources—such as localhost services or cloud-provider metadata endpoints—become reachable. The endpoint takes a URL from the user and calls it server-side via fopen() without any safeguards. There is no IP address validation, nor are there any allow-list, timeout, or size restrictions. Because of this, attackers can point the application at internal targets. Using this flaw, an attacker can perform internal port scans or retrieve sensitive cloud metadata. Version 6.6.13 contains a patch for the issue.

            <div class="field field--name-field-chapo field--type-string-long field--label-hidden field__item">À l’occasion de la publication de la quatrième édition de l’Observatoire des métiers, le Centre de Formation à la Sécurité des Systèmes d’Information (CFSSI) de l’ANSSI, en partenariat avec l’AFPA et la DGEFP, fait le point sur les évolutions du marché de l’emploi dans le domaine de la cybersécurité, au cours des cinq dernières années.</div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-texte-riche field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Face à une menace cyber toujours plus présente, les différents acteurs du secteur public et privé se doivent de mettre en place des stratégies efficaces pour se protéger. À l’heure où le recrutement de spécialistes en matière de sécurité des systèmes d’information apparaît, de fait, essentiel, l’analyse du marché du travail réalisée dans cette 4<sup>e</sup> édition de l’Observatoire des métiers démontre que le nombre d’offres d’emploi disponibles a considérablement augmenté dans ce secteur.</p>
<p>Seulement, les employeurs continuent à rencontrer de grandes difficultés pour trouver des candidats, et ce, malgré le développement de nombreuses offres de formations pour répondre aux besoins du marché.</p>
<h3>Le rôle de l’Observatoire des métiers</h3>
<p>Afin de comprendre les raisons réelles de cette pénurie et d’identifier les leviers les plus pertinents qui pourraient permettre aux politiques publiques de lancer des initiatives capables de résoudre la situation, l’ANSSI, la Délégation générale à l’Emploi et à la Formation professionnelle (DGEFP) et l’Agence nationale pour la formation professionnelle des adultes (Afpa), recensent et collectent des indicateurs concernant les formations en cybersécurité ainsi que les offres d’emploi dans ce domaine, depuis 2021, via l’Observatoire des métiers.</p>
<h3>Les résultats de l’enquête 2025 réalisée auprès des professionnels de la cybersécurité</h3>
<p>En 2025, l’Observatoire des métiers a reconduit l’enquête menée en 2021 auprès des professionnels de la cybersécurité afin de réaliser une photographie générale de la population composant l’écosystème cyber français. L’objectif étant de mieux connaître certaines de leurs caractéristiques : parcours, profils, cadres d’exercices des missions et perspectives d’évolutions.</p>
<h4>Quelques chiffres clés</h4>
<ul><li>1 répondant sur 2 travaille dans une structure de 1 000 salariés ou plus et 66 % des répondants travaillent dans le secteur privé.</li>
<li>Une large majorité d’hommes, soit 85 % des répondants, composent l’écosystème cyber français.</li>
<li>Pour la moitié des répondants, la cybersécurité ne constitue pas leur domaine d’expertise d’origine. En effet, 40 % des répondants ont principalement exercé dans le domaine de l’informatique/ numérique et 12 % ont principalement exercé dans un autre domaine.</li>
</ul><h3>Les résultats de l’étude 2025 menée sur le marché du travail des professionnels de la cybersécurité</h3>
<p>Cette seconde enquête, réalisée à partir d’un un outil d’agrégation, a permis de quantifier et d’analyser plus de 23 000 offres d’emploi publiées entre juin 2023 et juin 2024, dans le domaine de la cybersécurité, en France. L’objectif ? Identifier les grandes tendances du marché, notamment les types d’offres, le niveau de qualifications attendu ou encore la localisation des offres.</p>
<h4>Quelques chiffres clés</h4>
<ul><li>Une augmentation de 49 % du nombres d’offres d’emploi s’est opérée entre 2019 et 2024.</li>
<li>Une large majorité des offres concernent des contrats à durée indéterminée.</li>
<li>Le niveau de qualification reste élevé avec 40 % des offres qui requièrent un niveau Bac+5.</li>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-texte-riche field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Cette récompense vient saluer l’article de Hugues Randriam intitulé <em>« The syzygy distinguisher », </em>dont les conclusions représentent une avancée significative dans le domaine du chiffrement asymétrique.</p>
<p>L’étude propose en effet un nouvel outil mathématique appelé <em>« syzygy distinguisher »</em>. Déjà utilisé en cryptographie, les distinguisher ont toutefois montré des limites face à certains problèmes complexes de cryptographie. Celui proposé par Hugues dans son papier offre des résultats considérablement supérieurs lorsqu’il s’agit de reconnaître des codes cryptographiques utilisés pour sécuriser les communications, notamment dans le cadre de la cryptographie post-quantique.</p>
<p>L’attribution de ce prix constitue une reconnaissance forte des travaux menés par Hugues Randriam et par l’ensemble du laboratoire de cryptographie de l’ANSSI. Elle souligne également l’engagement constant des équipes de l’Agence dans la recherche scientifique.</p>
<p>C’est une grande fierté pour l’ANSSI, non seulement pour le rayonnement de ses laboratoires, mais aussi pour le travail mené au quotidien par l’ensemble de ses agents.</p>

<p>Les « parcours de cybersécurité » avaient pour objectif d’élever la sécurité numérique des services publics, de dynamiser l’industrie de cybersécurité française et européenne et de favoriser des investissements durables au service de la cybersécurité des organisations.</p>
<p>Pendant 4 ans, l’ANSSI a conçu, déployé et piloté un dispositif d’accompagnement au profit des collectivités, des établissements de santé et des entités publiques. Ainsi, 945 entités parmi les plus vulnérables à la menace cyber ont pu bénéficier de cet accompagnement, dont :</p>
<ul><li>707 collectivités territoriales,</li>
<li>134 établissements de santé,</li>
<li>87 autres établissements publics,</li>
<li>17 centres de recherche et d’enseignement supérieur,</li>
</ul><p>Parmi celles-ci, 62 entités ont été accompagnées dans les territoires d’Outre-mer.</p>
<p>Les parcours ont permis d’élever le niveau de cyberdéfense des bénéficiaires de manière significative : en moyenne, les bénéficiaires sont passés d’un score de maturité cyber de D+ à B, soulignant un progrès conséquent. Grâce aux parcours, les entités ont réussi à s’intégrer dans l’écosystème cyber de leur territoire et de leur secteur, en lien avec l’ANSSI, et sont ainsi solidement ancrées dans une démarche de sécurisation à long terme.</p>
<p>Au-delà des bénéfices pour les entités accompagnées, les parcours de cybersécurité laissent un héritage exploitable dans la durée, notamment dans la perspective de la mise en œuvre de la directive NIS 2 avec la mise à disposition d’outils et de méthodes adaptés aux besoins de chaque bénéficiaire.</p>
<p>Le programme a permis de dynamiser l’offre industrielle de cybersécurité dans les territoires et de renforcer l’offre française et européenne de cybersécurité :</p>
<ul><li>197 prestataires présents sur l’ensemble du territoire national ont été impliqués.</li>
<li>40 millions d’euros ont été dédiés à l’acquisition de produits de cybersécurité français et européens (dont 33 millions d’euros pour des produits français).</li>
</ul><p>Les parcours de cybersécurité sont un succès, avec des effets tangibles et durables pour les bénéficiaires. Ils font partie d'un programme plus large de soutien à la transformation numérique et à la résilience des systèmes d'information, dans un contexte où les cybermenaces se multiplient.</p>

La menace à l’encontre des entités du secteur cible des entreprises de toute taille, dans le monde entier, et qui ont la gestion d’une large variété de moyen de transports. Répondant à ses missions de connaissance de la menace informatique, l’ANSSI partage un état de la menace sur le secteur du transport urbain.</p>
<h3><strong>Un secteur fortement exposé en 2024</strong></h3>
<p>Tout au long de l’année, le contexte des Jeux Olympiques et Paralympiques de Paris 2024 a mis en lumière l’exposition de ce secteur aux cyberattaques, les tensions géopolitiques ayant été un catalyseur fort de cette menace avec de nombreuses attaques par déni de services.</p>
<p>L’imbrication de plusieurs réseaux informatiques de grande taille ainsi que la diversité des équipements qui les composent met en exergue des niveaux de sécurisation hétérogène complexifiant d’autant plus les questions de sécurité des systèmes d’information et augmentant significativement la surface d’attaque.</p>
<p>Les entités du secteur sont également fortement ciblées en raison du grand nombre de données personnelles des usagers, ainsi une attention toute particulière doit être portée à la protection de ces bases de données qui font régulièrement l’objet d’attaques à des fins d’exfiltration.</p>
<h3><strong>Prévenir et se protéger contre ces menaces</strong></h3>
<p>Dans son état de la menace, l’ANSSI rappelle l’importance d’avoir une approche globale de la sécurité et recommande aux entités de réaliser une cartographie globale des systèmes d’information afin d’identifier les risques affectant l’entité ou encore mesurer la maturité des systèmes d’informations concernés.</p>
<p>Il est essentiel de travailler sur des modes de fonctionnement dégradé notamment pour assurer et préparer en parallèle un <strong>plan de continuité d’activité (PCA)</strong> et un <strong>plan de reprise d’activité (PRA)</strong>. La mise en pratique ces recommandations permettra au secteur des transports urbains d’anticiper ces menaces.</p>

<h3><strong>Les Jeux olympiques et paralympiques de Paris 2024 comme consécration du modèle français de cyberdéfense</strong></h3>
<p>En tant que cheffe de file du volet cyber, l’ANSSI a été au cœur de la préparation des Jeux olympiques et paralympiques de Paris 2024. Le succès de cet événement international majeur est un accomplissement pour l’Agence, qui témoigne également de la pertinence du modèle de cyberdéfense français bâti autour d’une autorité nationale et ancré dans un écosystème élargi et déployé dans les territoires. Les Jeux sont le résultat d’une méthode – anticipation, préparation, entraînement – et d’une équipe – l’écosystème cyber public et privé – qui doivent perdurer pour<strong> permettre à la France de rester parmi les grandes nations de la cybersécurité.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>La directive NIS 2, vecteur d’une transformation profonde pour l’ANSSI</strong></h3>
<p>En 2024, l’ANSSI a poursuivi ses travaux de transposition de la directive NIS 2 qui sont le moteur d’un changement majeur de son organisation, de ses méthodes et de sa manière d’interagir avec ses bénéficiaires et ses partenaires. Déjà fortement mobilisées sur le sujet au cours des dernières années, les équipes de l’Agence continueront de l’être au quotidien, en coordination avec l’écosystème cyber, pour accompagner des milliers d’entités dans leur cybersécurité.</p>
<h3><strong>Des progrès précieux pour l’élévation générale de la cybersécurité de l’Union européenne</strong></h3>
<p>À l’image du cadre réglementaire défini par NIS 2, ou encore du vote du règlement sur la résilience cyber, pour lesquels l’ANSSI s’est pleinement engagée, la cybersécurité en Europe a connu de belles avancées en 2024. Par ailleurs, face aux évolutions technologiques, et notamment aux technologies de rupture, la conservation d’une maîtrise souveraine des expertises techniques s’impose comme une mission essentielle de l’ANSSI.</p>
<h4><strong>L’année 2024 en quelques chiffres :</strong></h4>
<ul><li><strong>656 </strong>agents âgés en moyenne de <strong>36 </strong>ans, œuvrent au quotidien pour la cybersécurité de la Nation, au sein de l’ANSSI.</li>
<li><strong>4 386 (+15%)</strong> événements de sécurité traités par l’ANSSI, et <strong>1 361 (+18%)</strong> incidents ayant impliqué un acteur malveillant.</li>
<li><strong>68</strong> formations labellisées SecNumedu, <strong>1 696</strong> personnes formées au Centre de formation à la sécurité des systèmes d’information (CFSSI) et <strong>117 856</strong> attestations SecNumacadémie décernées.</li>
</ul><h4><strong>L’année 2024 en quelques dates clés :</strong></h4>
<p>Au-delà des JOP24 d’autres d’événements ont marqué l’année 2024 :</p>
<ul><li><strong>31 janvier</strong> : Adoption du schéma européen de certification de cybersécurité fondé sur des critères commun.</li>
<li><strong>10 mai </strong>: Entrée en vigueur du décret d’application de la loi de programmation militaire 2024-2030, permettant à l’ANSSI de mettre en œuvre l’ensemble des nouvelles capacités dont elle l’a dotée.</li>
<li><strong>9 juillet </strong>: Publications des recommandations de l’ANSSI pour l’hébergement des systèmes d’information sensible dans le cloud.</li>
<li><strong>15 octobre </strong>: Présentation en conseil des ministres du projet de loi relatif à la résilience des activités d’importance vitale, à la protection des infrastructures critiques à la cybersécurité et à la résilience opérationnelle du secteur financier dont le titre II, Cybersécurité, vise à transposer la directive NIS 2.</li>

          Cette année exceptionnelle ouvre désormais la voie à une nouvelle étape pour l’ANSSI, qui a été partagée dans notre stratégie pour 2025-2027 . Il s’agit de prendre acte des évolutions non seulement du paysage cyber, mais également de notre environnement plus global. Pour ce faire, nous aurons besoin de « l’équipe de France » de cybersécurité à nos côtes.
