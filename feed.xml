Les objectifs sont pluriels : responsabiliser les fabricants, les importateurs et les distributeurs et renforcer la confiance des consommateurs.</p>
<p>L'ANSSI, en tant qu'autorité nationale en matière de cybersécurité et de cyberdéfense, est fortement impliquée dans la mise en application du CRA. Autorité nationale de certification de cybersécurité au titre du Cyber Security Act (CSA), l’ANSSI assurera également le rôle d’autorité notifiante au titre du CRA en charge d’évaluer, de contrôler et de notifier les organismes d’évaluation de la conformité (OEC) exerçant dans ce cadre.</p>
<p>En effet, le règlement 2024/2847 dit CRA requiert le recours à des organismes notifiés pour évaluer la conformité au règlement CRA notamment pour les produits importants de classe II et les produits critiques. L’ANSSI pourra notifier ces organismes d’évaluation de la conformité dès juin 2026.</p>
<p>Le règlement CRA énonce des exigences relatives à ces OEC et permet aux Etats membres de s’appuyer sur l’accréditation pour l’évaluation de ces exigences, et donc pour la France sur un programme élaboré par le COFRAC.</p>
<p>Dans ce contexte, l’ANSSI souhaite se rapprocher des OEC qui sont amenés à jouer ce rôle central afin de mettre en place le cadre national en lien avec l’écosystème concerné.</p>

      <title>CVE-2025-54365 - Fastapi-Guard Regular Expression ReDoS Bypass</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54365
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 4 days, 7 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>fastapi-guard is a security library for FastAPI that provides middleware to control IPs, log requests, detect penetration attempts and more. In version 3.0.1, the regular expression patched to mitigate the ReDoS vulnerability by limiting the length of string fails to catch inputs that exceed this limit. This type of patch fails to detect cases in which the string representing the attributes of a <script> tag exceeds 100 characters. As a result, most of the regex patterns present in version 3.0.1 can be bypassed. This is fixed in version 3.0.2.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2016-15044
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 4 days, 8 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Kaltura versions prior to 11.1.0-2 due to unsafe deserialization of user-controlled data within the keditorservices module. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this issue by sending a specially crafted serialized PHP object in the kdata GET parameter to the redirectWidgetCmd endpoint. Successful exploitation leads to execution of arbitrary PHP code in the context of the web server process.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32019
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 4 days, 9 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Harbor is an open source trusted cloud native registry project that stores, signs, and scans content.

      <title>CVE-2025-47281 - Kyverno JMESPath Variable Substitution Denial of Service</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47281
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 4 days, 9 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. In versions 1.14.1 and below, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists due to improper handling of JMESPath variable substitutions. Attackers with permissions to create or update Kyverno policies can craft expressions using the {{@}} variable combined with a pipe and an invalid JMESPath function (e.g., {{@ | non_existent_function }}). This leads to a nil value being substituted into the policy structure. Subsequent processing by internal functions, specifically getValueAsStringMap, which expect string values, results in a panic due to a type assertion failure (interface {} is nil, not string). This crashes Kyverno worker threads in the admission controller and causes continuous crashes of the reports controller pod. This is fixed in version 1.14.2.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53537
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 4 days, 9 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>LibHTP is a security-aware parser for the HTTP protocol and its related bits and pieces. In versions 0.5.50 and below, there is a traffic-induced memory leak that can starve the process of memory, leading to loss of visibility. To workaround this issue, set `suricata.yaml app-layer.protocols.http.libhtp.default-config.lzma-enabled` to false. This issue is fixed in version 0.5.51.

      <title>CVE-2025-53942 - Authentik OAuth/SAML Deactivated User Partial Access Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53942
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 4 days, 9 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>authentik is an open-source Identity Provider that emphasizes flexibility and versatility, with support for a wide set of protocols. In versions 2025.4.4 and earlier, as well as versions 2025.6.0-rc1 through 2025.6.3, deactivated users who registered through OAuth/SAML or linked their accounts to OAuth/SAML providers can still retain partial access to the system despite their accounts being deactivated. They end up in a half-authenticated state where they cannot access the API but crucially they can authorize applications if they know the URL of the application. To workaround this issue, developers can add an expression policy to the user login stage on the respective authentication flow with the expression of return request.context["pending_user"].is_active. This modification ensures that the return statement only activates the user login stage when the user is active. This issue is fixed in versions authentik 2025.4.4 and 2025.6.4.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54377
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 4 days, 9 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent that lives in users' editors. In versions 3.23.18 and below, RooCode does not validate line breaks (\n) in its command input, allowing potential bypass of the allow-list mechanism. The project appears to lack parsing or validation logic to prevent multi-line command injection. When commands are evaluated for execution, only the first line or token may be considered, enabling attackers to smuggle additional commands in subsequent lines. This is fixed in version 3.23.19.

      <title>CVE-2025-8058 - "GNU C Library Regcomp Double Free Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-8058
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 4 days, 10 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The regcomp function in the GNU C library version from 2.4 to 2.41 is 
subject to a double free if some previous allocation fails. It can be 
accomplished either by a malloc failure or by using an interposed malloc
 that injects random malloc failures. The double free can allow buffer 
manipulation depending of how the regex is constructed. This issue

      <title>CVE-2015-10141 - Xdebug OS Command Injection</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2015-10141
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unauthenticated OS command injection vulnerability exists within Xdebug versions 2.5.5 and earlier, a PHP debugging extension developed by Derick Rethans. When remote debugging is enabled, Xdebug listens on port 9000 and accepts debugger protocol commands without authentication. An attacker can send a crafted eval command over this interface to execute arbitrary PHP code, which may invoke system-level functions such as system() or passthru(). This results in full compromise of the host under the privileges of the web server user.

      <title>CVE-2016-15045 - Deepin lastore-daemon D-Bus Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2016-15045
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in lastore-daemon, the system package manager daemon used in Deepin Linux (developed by Wuhan Deepin Technology Co., Ltd.). In versions 0.9.53-1 (Deepin 15.5) and 0.9.66-1 (Deepin 15.7), the D-Bus configuration permits any user in the sudo group to invoke the InstallPackage method without password authentication. By default, the first user created on Deepin is in the sudo group. An attacker with shell access can craft a .deb package containing a malicious post-install script and use dbus-send to install it via lastore-daemon, resulting in arbitrary code execution as root.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2017-20198
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Marathon UI in DC/OS < 1.9.0 allows unauthenticated users to deploy arbitrary Docker containers. Due to improper restriction of volume mount configurations, attackers can deploy a container that mounts the host's root filesystem (/) with read/write privileges. When using a malicious Docker image, the attacker can write to /etc/cron.d/ on the host, achieving arbitrary code execution with root privileges. This impacts any system where the Docker daemon honors Marathon container configurations without policy enforcement.

      <title>CVE-2025-8070 - "ABP AES Unquoted Service Path Privilege Escalation Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-8070
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 14 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Windows service configuration of ABP and AES contains an unquoted ImagePath registry value vulnerability. This allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious executable in a predictable location such as C:\Program.exe. If the service runs with elevated privileges, exploitation results in privilege escalation to SYSTEM level. This vulnerability arises from an unquoted service path affecting systems where the executable resides in a path containing spaces.
Affected products and versions include: ABP 2.0.7.6130 and earlier as well as AES 1.0.6.6133 and earlier.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6190
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Realty Portal – Agent plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization within the rp_user_profile() AJAX handler in versions 0.1.0 through 0.3.9. The handler reads the client-supplied meta key and value pairs from $_POST and passes them directly to update_user_meta() without restricting to a safe whitelist. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to overwrite the wp_capabilities meta and grant themselves the administrator role.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Omnishop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery on its /users/delete REST route in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. The route’s permission_callback only verifies that the requester is logged in, but fails to require any nonce or other proof of intent.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Omnishop plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Registration Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. Its /users/register endpoint is exposed to the public (permission_callback always returns true) and invokes wp_create_user() unconditionally,  ignoring the site’s users_can_register option and any nonce or CAPTCHA checks. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create arbitrary user accounts (customer) on sites where registrations should be closed.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54139
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 23, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>HAX CMS allows users to manage their microsite universe with a NodeJS or PHP backend. In haxcms-nodejs versions 11.0.12 and below and in haxcms-php versions 11.0.7 and below, all pages within the HAX CMS application do not contain headers to prevent other websites from loading the site within an iframe. This applies to both the CMS and generated sites. An unauthenticated attacker can load the standalone login page or other sensitive functionality within an iframe, performing a UI redressing attack (clickjacking). This can be used to perform social engineering attacks to attempt to coerce users into performing unintended actions within the HAX CMS application. This is fixed in haxcms-nodejs version 11.0.13 and haxcms-php 11.0.8.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 42 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Suricata is a network IDS, IPS and NSM engine developed by the OISF (Open Information Security Foundation) and the Suricata community. In versions 7.0.10 and below and  8.0.0-beta1 through 8.0.0-rc1, mishandling of data on HTTP2 stream 0 can lead to uncontrolled memory usage, leading to loss of visibility. Workarounds include disabling the HTTP/2 parser, and using a signature like drop http2 any any -> any any (frame:http2.hdr; byte_test:1,=,0,3; byte_test:4,=,0,5; sid: 1;) where the first byte test tests the HTTP2 frame type DATA and the second tests the stream id 0. This is fixed in versions 7.0.11 and 8.0.0.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 42 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>yt-dlp is a feature-rich command-line audio/video downloader. In versions 2025.06.25 and below, when the --exec option is used on Windows with the default placeholder (or {}), insufficient sanitization is applied to the expanded filepath, allowing for remote code execution. This is a bypass of the mitigation for CVE-2024-22423 where the default placeholder and {} were not covered by the new escaping rules. Windows users who are unable to upgrade should avoid using --exec altogether. Instead, the --write-info-json or --dump-json options could be used, with an external script or command line consuming the JSON output. This is fixed in version 2025.07.21.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 42 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>HAX CMS NodeJS allows users to manage their microsite universe with a NodeJS backend. Versions 11.0.9 and below were distributed with hardcoded default credentials for the user and superuser accounts. Additionally, the application has default private keys for JWTs. Users aren't prompted to change credentials or secrets during installation, and there is no way to change them through the UI. An unauthenticated attacker can read the default user credentials and JWT private keys from the public haxtheweb GitHub repositories. These credentials and keys can be used to access unconfigured self-hosted instances of the application, modify sites, and perform further attacks. This is fixed in version 11.0.10.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54138
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 42 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring which includes support for a wide range of network hardware and operating systems. LibreNMS versions 25.6.0 and below contain an architectural vulnerability in the ajax_form.php endpoint that permits Remote File Inclusion based on user-controlled POST input. The application directly uses the type parameter to dynamically include .inc.php files from the trusted path includes/html/forms/, without validation or allowlisting. This pattern introduces a latent Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector if an attacker can stage a file in this include path — for example, via symlink, development misconfiguration, or chained vulnerabilities. This is fixed in version 25.7.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-54140 - pyLoad Path Traversal Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54140
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 42 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>pyLoad is a free and open-source Download Manager written in pure Python. In version 0.5.0b3.dev89, an authenticated path traversal vulnerability exists in the /json/upload endpoint of pyLoad. By manipulating the filename of an uploaded file, an attacker can traverse out of the intended upload directory, allowing them to write arbitrary files to any location on the system accessible to the pyLoad process. This may lead to: Remote Code Execution (RCE), local privilege escalation, system-wide compromise, persistence, and backdoors. This is fixed in version 0.5.0b3.dev90.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-51860
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in TelegAI (telegai.com) 2025-05-26 in its chat component and character container component. An attacker can achieve arbitrary client-side script execution by crafting an AI Character with SVG XSS payloads in either description, greeting, example dialog, or system prompt(instructing the LLM to embed XSS payload in its chat response). When a user interacts with such a malicious AI Character or just browse its profile, the script executes in the user's browser. Successful exploitation can lead to the theft of sensitive information, such as session tokens, potentially resulting in account hijacking.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability exists in ETQ Reliance on the CG (legacy) platform within the `/resources/sessions/sso` endpoint. The SAML authentication handler processes XML input without disabling external entity resolution, allowing crafted SAML responses to invoke external entity references. This could enable attackers to retrieve sensitive files or perform server-side request forgery (SSRF). The issue was addressed by disabling external entity processing for the affected XML parser in versions SE.2025.1 and 2025.1.2.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in ETQ Reliance on the CG (legacy) platform. The application allowed login as the privileged internal SYSTEM user by manipulating the username field. The SYSTEM account does not require a password, enabling attackers with network access to the login page to obtain elevated access. Once authenticated, an attacker could achieve remote code execution by modifying Jython scripts within the application. This issue was resolved by introducing stricter validation logic to exclude internal accounts from public authentication workflows in version MP-4583.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6082
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Birth Chart Compatibility plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.0. This is due to insufficient protection against directly accessing the plugin's index.php file, which causes an error exposing the full path. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6187
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The bSecure plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to missing authorization within its order_info REST endpoint in versions 1.3.7 through 1.7.9. The plugin registers the /webhook/v2/order_info/ route with a permission_callback that always returns true, effectively bypassing all authentication. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers who know any user’s email to obtain a valid login cookie and fully impersonate that account.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Nginx Cache Purge Preload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.1 via the 'nppp_preload_cache_on_update' function. This is due to insufficient sanitization of the $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERERER'] parameter passed from the 'nppp_handle_fastcgi_cache_actions_admin_bar' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to execute code on the server.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Orion Login with SMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to the olws_handle_verify_phone() function not utilizing a strong enough OTP value, exposing the hash needed to generate the OTP value, and no restrictions on the number of attempts to submit the code. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users, including administrators, if they have access to their phone number.

      <title>CVE-2025-38352 - Linux Kernel POSIX CPU Timers Race Condition Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38352
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 7 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-cpu-timers: fix race between handle_posix_cpu_timers() and posix_cpu_timer_del()

If an exiting non-autoreaping task has already passed exit_notify() and
calls handle_posix_cpu_timers() from IRQ, it can be reaped by its parent
or debugger right after unlock_task_sighand().

If a concurrent posix_cpu_timer_del() runs at that moment, it won't be
able to detect timer->it.cpu.firing != 0: cpu_timer_task_rcu() and/or
lock_task_sighand() will fail.

Add the tsk->exit_state check into run_posix_cpu_timers() to fix this.

This fix is not needed if CONFIG_POSIX_CPU_TIMERS_TASK_WORK=y, because
exit_task_work() is called before exit_notify(). But the check still
makes sense, task_work_add(&tsk->posix_cputimers_work.work) will fail
anyway in this case.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7645
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 22, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 8 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Extensions For CF7 (Contact form 7 Database, Conditional Fields and Redirection) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'delete-file' field in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, when an administrator deletes the submission, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 21, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Lara Translate MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for Lara Translate API. Versions 0.0.11 and below contain a command injection vulnerability which exists in the @translated/lara-mcp MCP Server. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to child_process.exec, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces the possibility of shell metacharacter injection (|, >, &&, etc.). This vulnerability is fixed in version 0.0.12.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 21, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>HAXcms with nodejs backend allows users to start the server in any HAXsite or HAXcms instance. In versions 11.0.6 and below, the NodeJS version of HAXcms uses an insecure default configuration designed for local development. The default configuration does not perform authorization or authentication checks. If a user were to deploy haxcms-nodejs without modifying the default settings, ‘HAXCMS_DISABLE_JWT_CHECKS‘ would be set to ‘true‘ and their deployment would lack session authentication. This is fixed in version 11.0.7.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 21, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>HAX CMS NodeJs allows users to manage their microsite universe with a NodeJs backend. In versions 11.0.7 and below, the NodeJS version of HAX CMS has a disabled Content Security Policy (CSP). This configuration is insecure for a production application because it does not protect against cross-site-scripting attacks. The contentSecurityPolicy value is explicitly disabled in the application's Helmet configuration in app.js. This is fixed in version 11.0.8.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 21, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>HAXiam is a packaging wrapper for HAXcms which allows anyone to spawn their own microsite management platform. In versions 11.0.4 and below, the application returns a 200 response when requesting the data of a valid user and a 404 response when requesting the data of an invalid user. This can be used to infer the existence of valid user accounts. An authenticated attacker can use automated tooling to brute force potential usernames and use the application's response to identify valid accounts. This can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, such as the lack of authorization checks, to enumerate and deface another user's sites. This is fixed in version 11.0.5.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>HAX CMS NodeJs allows users to manage their microsite universe with a NodeJs backend. In versions 11.0.8 and below, the HAX CMS NodeJS application crashes when an authenticated attacker provides an API request lacking required URL parameters.

      <title>CVE-2025-47917 - Mbed TLS Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47917
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 20, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Mbed TLS before 3.6.4 allows a use-after-free in certain situations of applications that are developed in accordance with the documentation. The function mbedtls_x509_string_to_names() takes a head argument that is documented as an output argument. The documentation does not suggest that the function will free that pointer; however, the function does call mbedtls_asn1_free_named_data_list() on that argument, which performs a deep free(). As a result, application code that uses this function (relying only on documented behavior) is likely to still hold pointers to the memory blocks that were freed, resulting in a high risk of use-after-free or double-free. In particular, the two sample programs x509/cert_write and x509/cert_req are affected (use-after-free if the san string contains more than one DN).

      <title>CVE-2025-38351 - KVM Hyper-V Canonical GVA Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38351
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 19, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 12 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86/hyper-v: Skip non-canonical addresses during PV TLB flush

In KVM guests with Hyper-V hypercalls enabled, the hypercalls
HVCALL_FLUSH_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS_LIST and HVCALL_FLUSH_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS_LIST_EX
allow a guest to request invalidation of portions of a virtual TLB.
For this, the hypercall parameter includes a list of GVAs that are supposed
to be invalidated.

However, when non-canonical GVAs are passed, there is currently no
filtering in place and they are eventually passed to checked invocations of
INVVPID on Intel / INVLPGA on AMD.  While AMD's INVLPGA silently ignores
non-canonical addresses (effectively a no-op), Intel's INVVPID explicitly
signals VM-Fail and ultimately triggers the WARN_ONCE in invvpid_error():

  invvpid failed: ext=0x0 vpid=1 gva=0xaaaaaaaaaaaaa000
  WARNING: CPU: 6 PID: 326 at arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c:482
  invvpid_error+0x91/0xa0 [kvm_intel]
  Modules linked in: kvm_intel kvm 9pnet_virtio irqbypass fuse
  CPU: 6 UID: 0 PID: 326 Comm: kvm-vm Not tainted 6.15.0 #14 PREEMPT(voluntary)
  RIP: 0010:invvpid_error+0x91/0xa0 [kvm_intel]
  Call Trace:
    vmx_flush_tlb_gva+0x320/0x490 [kvm_intel]
    kvm_hv_vcpu_flush_tlb+0x24f/0x4f0 [kvm]
    kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x3013/0x5810 [kvm]

Hyper-V documents that invalid GVAs (those that are beyond a partition's
GVA space) are to be ignored.  While not completely clear whether this
ruling also applies to non-canonical GVAs, it is likely fine to make that
assumption, and manual testing on Azure confirms "real" Hyper-V interprets
the specification in the same way.

Skip non-canonical GVAs when processing the list of address to avoid
tripping the INVVPID failure.  Alternatively, KVM could filter out "bad"
GVAs before inserting into the FIFO, but practically speaking the only
downside of pushing validation to the final processing is that doing so
is suboptimal for the guest, and no well-behaved guest will request TLB
flushes for non-canonical addresses.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6997
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 19, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 7 hours, 51 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The ThemeREX Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 2.35.1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. The plugin’s SVG rendering routine calls the trx_addons_get_svg_from_file() function on an unvalidated 'svg' parameter supplied via the shortcode or Elementor widget settings, then outputs it via the trx_addons_show_layout() function.  Because there is no check on the URL’s origin, scheme, or the SVG content itself, authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, can supply a remote SVG and inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.

      <title>CVE-2025-38350 - Linux Kernel HFSC Netem Blackhole Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38350
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 19, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 51 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: Always pass notifications when child class becomes empty

Certain classful qdiscs may invoke their classes' dequeue handler on an
enqueue operation. This may unexpectedly empty the child qdisc and thus
make an in-flight class passive via qlen_notify(). Most qdiscs do not
expect such behaviour at this point in time and may re-activate the
class eventually anyways which will lead to a use-after-free.

The referenced fix commit attempted to fix this behavior for the HFSC
case by moving the backlog accounting around, though this turned out to
be incomplete since the parent's parent may run into the issue too.
The following reproducer demonstrates this use-after-free:

    tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: drr
    tc filter add dev lo parent 1: basic classid 1:1
    tc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 drr
    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2: hfsc def 1
    tc class add dev lo parent 2: classid 2:1 hfsc rt m1 8 d 1 m2 0
    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 2:1 handle 3: netem
    tc qdisc add dev lo parent 3:1 handle 4: blackhole

    echo 1 | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888
    tc class delete dev lo classid 1:1
    echo 1 | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888

Since backlog accounting issues leading to a use-after-frees on stale
class pointers is a recurring pattern at this point, this patch takes
a different approach. Instead of trying to fix the accounting, the patch
ensures that qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog always calls qlen_notify when
the child qdisc is empty. This solves the problem because deletion of
qdiscs always involves a call to qdisc_reset() and / or
qdisc_purge_queue() which ultimately resets its qlen to 0 thus causing
the following qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() to report to the parent. Note
that this may call qlen_notify on passive classes multiple times. This
is not a problem after the recent patch series that made all the
classful qdiscs qlen_notify() handlers idempotent.

      <title>CVE-2025-7394 - OpenSSL wolfSSL Predictable Random Number Generation After Fork Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7394
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 18, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the OpenSSL compatibility layer implementation, the function RAND_poll() was not behaving as expected and leading to the potential for predictable values returned from RAND_bytes() after fork() is called. This can lead to weak or predictable random numbers generated in applications that are both using RAND_bytes() and doing fork() operations. This only affects applications explicitly calling RAND_bytes() after fork() and does not affect any internal TLS operations. Although RAND_bytes() documentation in OpenSSL calls out not being safe for use with fork() without first calling RAND_poll(), an additional code change was also made in wolfSSL to make RAND_bytes() behave similar to OpenSSL after a fork() call without calling RAND_poll(). Now the Hash-DRBG used gets reseeded after detecting running in a new process. If making use of RAND_bytes() and calling fork() we recommend updating to the latest version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Per Allansson from Appgate for the report.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 18, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In wolfSSL release 5.8.2 blinding support is turned on by default for Curve25519 in applicable builds. The blinding configure option is only for the base C implementation of Curve25519. It is not needed, or available with; ARM assembly builds, Intel assembly builds, and the small Curve25519 feature. While the side-channel attack on extracting a private key would be very difficult to execute in practice, enabling blinding provides an additional layer of protection for devices that may be more susceptible to physical access or side-channel observation.

      <title>CVE-2025-53901 - Wasmtime WASIp1 Denial-of-Service Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53901
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 18, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 39 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Wasmtime is a runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to versions 24.0.4, 33.0.2, and 34.0.2, a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of the WASIp1 set of import functions can lead to a WebAssembly guest inducing a panic in the host (embedder). The specific bug is triggered by calling `path_open` after calling `fd_renumber` with either two equal argument values or a second argument being equal to a previously-closed file descriptor number value. The corrupt state introduced in `fd_renumber` will lead to the subsequent opening of a file descriptor to panic. This panic cannot introduce memory unsafety or allow WebAssembly to break outside of its sandbox, however. There is no possible heap corruption or memory unsafety from this panic. This bug is in the implementation of Wasmtime's `wasmtime-wasi` crate which provides an implementation of WASIp1. The bug requires a specially crafted call to `fd_renumber` in addition to the ability to open a subsequent file descriptor. Opening a second file descriptor is only possible when a preopened directory was provided to the guest, and this is common amongst embeddings. A panic in the host is considered a denial-of-service vector for WebAssembly embedders and is thus a security issue in Wasmtime. This bug does not affect WASIp2 and embedders using components. In accordance with Wasmtime's release process, patch releases are available as 24.0.4, 33.0.2, and 34.0.2. Users of other release of Wasmtime are recommended to move to a supported release of Wasmtime. Embedders who are using components or are not providing guest access to create more file descriptors (e.g. via a preopened filesystem directory) are not affected by this issue. Otherwise, there is no workaround at this time, and affected embeddings are recommended to update to a patched version which will not cause a panic in the host.

      <title>CVE-2025-53888 - RIOT-OS L2FILTER Add Buffer Overflow</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53888
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 18, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>RIOT-OS, an operating system that supports Internet of Things devices, has an ineffective size check implemented with `assert()` can lead to buffer overflow in versions up to and including 2025.04. Assertions are usually compiled out in production builds. If assertions are the only defense against untrusted inputs, the software may be exposed to attacks that utilize the lack of proper input checks. In the `l2filter_add()` function shown below, `addr_len` is checked using an assertion and is subsequently used as an argument in a `memcpy()` call. When assertions are disabled, there would be no size check for `addr_len`. As a consequence, if an attacker were to provide an `addr_len` value larger than `CONFIG_L2FILTER_ADDR_MAXLEN`, they can trigger a buffer overflow and write past the `list[i].addr` buffer. If the unchecked input is attacker-controlled, the impact of the buffer overflow can range from a denial of service to arbitrary code execution. Commit f6f7de4ccc107c018630e4c15500825caf02e1c2 contains a patch for the vulnerability.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54073
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 18, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>mcp-package-docs is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides LLMs with efficient access to package documentation across multiple programming languages and language server protocol (LSP) capabilities. A command injection vulnerability exists in the `mcp-package-docs` MCP Server prior to the fix in commit cb4ad49615275379fd6f2f1cf1ec4731eec56eb9. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to `child_process.exec`, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges. The server constructs and executes shell commands using unvalidated user input directly within command-line strings. This introduces the possibility of shell metacharacter injection (`|`, `>`, `&&`, etc.). Commit cb4ad49615275379fd6f2f1cf1ec4731eec56eb9 in version 0.1.27 contains a fix for the issue, but upgrading to 0.1.28 is recommended.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>MDC is a tool to take regular Markdown and write documents interacting deeply with a Vue component. Prior to version 0.17.2, a remote script-inclusion / stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in @nuxtjs/mdc lets a Markdown author inject a `<base href="https://attacker.tld">` element. The `<base>` tag rewrites how all subsequent relative URLs are resolved, so an attacker can make the page load scripts, styles, or images from an external, attacker-controlled origin and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the site’s context. Version 0.17.2 contains a fix for the issue.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46732
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 18, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 24 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>OpenCTI is an open source platform for managing cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. Prior to version 6.6.6, an IDOR vulnerability in the GrapQL `NotificationLineNotificationMarkReadMutation` and `NotificationLineNotificationDeleteMutation` mutations of OpenCTI allows an authenticated user to change the read status of a notification or delete a notification of another user in case he has knowledge of the UUID of the notification. When changing the read status of a notification, the user also receives the content of the notification they changed the read status of. Authenticated Users in OpenCTI can read, modify and delete notification of other users if they know the UUID of the notification. Version 6.6.6 fixes the issue.

Jann Horn points out that epoll is decrementing the ep refcount and then
doing a

    mutex_unlock(&ep->mtx);

afterwards. That's very wrong, because it can lead to a use-after-free.

That pattern is actually fine for the very last reference, because the
code in question will delay the actual call to "ep_free(ep)" until after
it has unlocked the mutex.

But it's wrong for the much subtler "next to last" case when somebody
*else* may also be dropping their reference and free the ep while we're
still using the mutex.

Note that this is true even if that other user is also using the same ep
mutex: mutexes, unlike spinlocks, can not be used for object ownership,
even if they guarantee mutual exclusion.

A mutex "unlock" operation is not atomic, and as one user is still
accessing the mutex as part of unlocking it, another user can come in
and get the now released mutex and free the data structure while the
first user is still cleaning up.

See our mutex documentation in Documentation/locking/mutex-design.rst,
in particular the section [1] about semantics:

	"mutex_unlock() may access the mutex structure even after it has
	 internally released the lock already - so it's not safe for
	 another context to acquire the mutex and assume that the
	 mutex_unlock() context is not using the structure anymore"

So if we drop our ep ref before the mutex unlock, but we weren't the
last one, we may then unlock the mutex, another user comes in, drops
_their_ reference and releases the 'ep' as it now has no users - all
while the mutex_unlock() is still accessing it.

Fix this by simply moving the ep refcount dropping to outside the mutex:
the refcount itself is atomic, and doesn't need mutex protection (that's
the whole _point_ of refcounts: unlike mutexes, they are inherently
about object lifetimes).

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3740
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 18, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 13 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The School Management System for Wordpress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 93.1.0 via the 'page' parameter.

The Local File Inclusion exploit can be chained to include various dashboard view files in the plugin. One such chain can be leveraged to update the password of Super Administrator accounts in Multisite environments making privilege escalation possible. The vendor has updated the version numbers beginning with `1.93.1 (02-07-2025)` for the patched version. This version comes after version 93.1.0.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54068
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 17, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Livewire is a full-stack framework for Laravel. In Livewire v3 up to and including v3.6.3, a vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote command execution in specific scenarios. The issue stems from how certain component property updates are hydrated. This vulnerability is unique to Livewire v3 and does not affect prior major versions. Exploitation requires a component to be mounted and configured in a particular way, but does not require authentication or user interaction. This issue has been patched in Livewire v3.6.4. All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to this version or later as soon as possible. No known workarounds are available.

      <title>CVE-2025-54070 - OpenZeppelin Contracts Memory Access Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54070
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 17, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Starting in version 5.2.0 and prior to version 5.4.0, the `lastIndexOf(bytes,byte,uint256)` function of the `Bytes.sol` library may access uninitialized memory when the following two conditions hold: 1) the provided buffer length is empty (i.e. `buffer.length == 0`) and position is not `2**256 - 1` (i.e. `pos != type(uint256).max`). The `pos` argument could be used to access arbitrary data outside of the buffer bounds. This could lead to the operation running out of gas, or returning an invalid index (outside of the empty buffer). Processing this invalid result for accessing the `buffer` would cause a revert under normal conditions. When triggered, the function reads memory at offset `buffer + 0x20 + pos`. If memory at that location (outside the `buffer`) matches the search pattern, the function would return an out of bound index instead of the expected `type(uint256).max`. This creates unexpected behavior where callers receive a valid-looking index pointing outside buffer bounds. Subsequent memory accesses that don't check bounds and use the returned index must carefully review the potential impact depending on their setup. Code relying on this function returning `type(uint256).max` for empty buffers or using the returned index without bounds checking could exhibit undefined behavior. Users should upgrade to version 5.4.0 to receive a patch.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 17, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Solady is software that provides Solidity snippets with APIs. Starting in version 0.0.125 and prior to version 0.1.24, when an account is deployed via a proxy, using regular Solidity to call its initialization function may result in a silent failure, if the initialization function does not return a `bool` or some other return data.  This is because regular Solidity uses `extcodesize(proxy)` to decide if call succeeds. This is insufficient in the case when the proxy points to an empty implementation. Users should upgrade to Solady v0.1.24 or later to receive a patch. Deploy any affected implementations and their factories on new EVM chains as soon as possible.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7338
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 17, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Multer is a node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`. A vulnerability that is present starting in version 1.4.4-lts.1 and prior to version 2.0.2 allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending a malformed multi-part upload request. This request causes an unhandled exception, leading to a crash of the process. Users should upgrade to version 2.0.2 to receive a patch. No known workarounds are available.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>on-headers is a node.js middleware for listening to when a response writes headers.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54066
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 17, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>DiracX-Web is a web application that provides an interface to interact with the DiracX services. Prior to version 0.1.0-a8, an attacker can forge a request that they can pass to redirect an authenticated user to another arbitrary website. In the login page, DiracX-Web has a `redirect` field which is the location where the server will redirect the user. This URI is not verified, and can be an arbitrary URI. Paired with a parameter pollution, an attacker can hide their malicious URI. This could be used for phishing, and extract new data (such as redirecting to a new "log in" page, and asking another time credentials). Version 0.1.0-a8 fixes this vulnerability.

      <title>CVE-2025-54064 - Rucio Apache Access Log Credentials Exposure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-54064
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 17, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 36 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Rucio is a software framework that provides functionality to organize, manage, and access large volumes of scientific data using customizable policies. The common Rucio helm-charts for the `rucio-server`, `rucio-ui`, and `rucio-webui` define the log format for the apache access log of these components. The `X-Rucio-Auth-Token`, which is part of each request header sent to Rucio, is part of this log format. Thus, each access log line potentially exposes the credentials (Internal Rucio token, or JWT in case of OIDC authentication) of the user. Due to the length of the token (Especially for a JWT) the tokens are often truncated, and thus not usable as credential; nevertheless, the (partial) credential should not be part of the logfile. The impact of this issue is amplified if the access logs are made available to a larger group of people than the instance administrators themselves. An updated release has been supplied for the `rucio-server`, `rucio-ui` and `rucio-webui` helm-chart. The change was also retrofitted for the currently supported Rucio LTS releases. The patched versions are rucio-server 37.0.2, 35.0.1, and 32.0.1; rucio-ui 37.0.4, 35.0.1, and 32.0.2; and rucio-webui 37.0.2, 35.1.1, and 32.0.1. As a workaround, one may update the `logFormat` variable and remove the `X-Rucio-Auth-Token`.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-1713
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 17, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 16 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>When setting up interrupt remapping for legacy PCI(-X) devices,
including PCI(-X) bridges, a lookup of the upstream bridge is required.
This lookup, itself involving acquiring of a lock, is done in a context
where acquiring that lock is unsafe.  This can lead to a deadlock.

      <title>CVE-2025-40924 - Catalyst::Plugin::Session Insecure Session ID Generation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-40924
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 17, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 16 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Catalyst::Plugin::Session before version 0.44 for Perl generates session ids insecurely.

The session id is generated from a (usually SHA-1) hash of a simple counter, the epoch time, the built-in rand function, the PID and the current Catalyst context. This information is of low entropy. The PID will come from a small set of numbers, and the epoch time may be guessed, if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.

Predicable session ids could allow an attacker to gain access to systems.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 17, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 16 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>MaxKB is an open-source AI assistant for enterprise. Prior to version 2.0.0, the sandbox design rules can be bypassed because MaxKB only restricts the execution permissions of files in a specific directory. Therefore, an attacker can use the `shutil.copy2` method in Python to copy the command they want to execute to the executable directory. This bypasses directory restrictions and reverse shell. Version 2.0.0 fixes the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-5994 - "Unbound DNS Rebirthday Attack Cache Poisoning Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-5994
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 16, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 38 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A multi-vendor cache poisoning vulnerability named 'Rebirthday Attack' has been discovered in caching resolvers that support EDNS Client Subnet (ECS). Unbound is also vulnerable when compiled with ECS support, i.e., '--enable-subnet', AND configured to send ECS information along with queries to upstream name servers, i.e., at least one of the 'send-client-subnet', 'client-subnet-zone' or 'client-subnet-always-forward' options is used. Resolvers supporting ECS need to segregate outgoing queries to accommodate for different outgoing ECS information. This re-opens up resolvers to a birthday paradox attack (Rebirthday Attack) that tries to match the DNS transaction ID in order to cache non-ECS poisonous replies.

      <title>CVE-2025-32874 - Kaseya Rapid Fire Tools Network Detective Cryptographic Implementation Flaw</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32874
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 16, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 32 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An issue was discovered in Kaseya Rapid Fire Tools Network Detective through 2.0.16.0. A vulnerability exists in the EncryptionUtil class because symmetric encryption is implemented in a deterministic and non-randomized fashion. The method Encrypt(byte[] clearData) derives both the encryption key and the IV from a fixed, hardcoded input by using a static salt value. As a result, identical plaintext inputs always produce identical ciphertext outputs. This is true for both FIPS and non-FIPS generated passwords. In other words, there is a cryptographic implementation flaw in the password encryption mechanism. Although there are multiple encryption methods grouped under FIPS and non-FIPS classifications, the logic consistently results in predictable and reversible encrypted outputs due to the lack of per-operation randomness and encryption authentication.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 16, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 32 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Icinga DB Web provides a graphical interface for Icinga monitoring. Starting in version 1.2.0 and prior to version 1.2.2, users with access to Icinga Dependency Views, are allowed to see hosts and services that they weren't meant to on the dependency map. However, the name of an object will not be revealed nor does this grant access to a host's or service's detail view. Please note that this only affects the restrictions `filter/hosts` and `filter/services`. `filter/objects` is not affected by this and restricts objects as it is supposed to. Version 1.2.2 applies these restrictions properly. As a workaround, one may downgrade to version 1.1.3.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53892
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 16, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 32 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Vue I18n is the internationalization plugin for Vue.js. The escapeParameterHtml: true option in Vue I18n is designed to protect against HTML/script injection by escaping interpolated parameters. However, starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to versions 9.14.5, 10.0.8, and 11.1.0, this setting fails to prevent execution of certain tag-based payloads, such as <img src=x onerror=...>, if the interpolated value is inserted inside an HTML context using v-html. This may lead to a DOM-based XSS vulnerability, even when using escapeParameterHtml: true, if a translation string includes minor HTML and is rendered via v-html. Versions 9.14.5, 10.0.8, and 11.1.0 contain a fix for the issue.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 16, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 32 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Authen::SASL::Perl::DIGEST_MD5 versions 2.04 through 2.1800 for Perl generates the cnonce insecurely.

The cnonce (client nonce) is generated from an MD5 hash of the PID, the epoch time and the built-in rand function. The PID will come from a small set of numbers, and the epoch time may be guessed, if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.

According to RFC 2831, "The cnonce-value is an opaque quoted string value provided by the client and used by both client and server to avoid chosen plaintext attacks, and to provide mutual authentication. The security of the implementation depends on a good choice. It is RECOMMENDED that it contain at least 64 bits of entropy."

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6993
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 16, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 31 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Ultimate WP Mail plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to improper authorization within the get_email_log_details() AJAX handler in versions 1.0.17 to 1.3.6. The handler reads the client-supplied post_id and retrieves the corresponding email log post content (including the password-reset link), relying only on the ‘edit_posts’ capability without restricting to administrators or validating ownership. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to harvest an admin’s reset link and elevate their privileges to administrator.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7699
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 16, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 31 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An improper access control vulnerability  was found in the EZ Sync Manager of ADM, which allows authenticated users to copy arbitrary files from the server file system into their own EZSync folder. The vulnerability is due to a lack of authorization checks on the file parameter of the HTTP request. Attackers can exploit this flaw to access files outside their authorized scope, provided the file has readable permissions for other users on the underlying OS. This can lead to unauthorized exposure of sensitive data.
Affected products and versions include: from ADM 4.1.0 to ADM 4.3.3.RH61 as well as ADM 5.0.0.RIN1 and earlier.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-27465
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 16, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Certain instructions need intercepting and emulating by Xen.  In some
cases Xen emulates the instruction by replaying it, using an executable
stub.  Some instructions may raise an exception, which is supposed to be
handled gracefully.  Certain replayed instructions have additional logic
to set up and recover the changes to the arithmetic flags.

For replayed instructions where the flags recovery logic is used, the
metadata for exception handling was incorrect, preventing Xen from
handling the the exception gracefully, treating it as fatal instead.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53906
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 13 hours, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Vim is an open source, command line text editor. Prior to version 9.1.1551, a path traversal issue in Vim’s zip.vim plugin can allow overwriting of arbitrary files when opening specially crafted zip archives. Impact is low because this exploit requires direct user interaction. However, successfully exploitation can lead to overwriting sensitive files or placing executable code in privileged locations, depending on the permissions of the process editing the archive. The victim must edit such a file using Vim which will reveal the filename and the file content, a careful user may suspect some strange things going on. Successful exploitation could results in the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. Version 9.1.1551 contains a patch for the vulnerability.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-49837
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 31 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>GPT-SoVITS-WebUI is a voice conversion and text-to-speech webUI. In versions 20250228v3 and prior, there is an unsafe deserialization vulnerability in vr.py AudioPre. The model_choose variable takes user input (e.g. a path to a model) and passes it to the uvr function. In uvr, a new instance of AudioPre class is created with the model_path attribute containing the aforementioned user input (here called locally model_name). Note that in this step the .pth extension is added to the path. In the AudioPre class, the user input, here called model_path, is used to load the model on that path with torch.load, which can lead to unsafe deserialization. At time of publication, no known patched versions are available.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-41238
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion contain a heap-overflow vulnerability in the PVSCSI (Paravirtualized SCSI) controller that leads to an out of-bounds write. A malicious actor with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine may exploit this issue to execute code as the virtual machine's VMX process running on the host. On ESXi, the exploitation is contained within the VMX sandbox and exploitable only with configurations that are unsupported. On Workstation and Fusion, this may lead to code execution on the machine where Workstation or Fusion is installed.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53893
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename, and edit files. In version 2.38.0, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the file processing logic when reading a file on endpoint  `Filebrowser-Server-IP:PORT/files/{file-name}` . While the server correctly handles and stores uploaded files, it attempts to load the entire content into memory during read operations without size checks or resource limits. This allows an authenticated user to upload a large file and trigger uncontrolled memory consumption on read, potentially crashing the server and making it unresponsive. As of time of publication, no known patches are available.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53895
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ZITADEL is an open source identity management system. Starting in version 2.53.0 and prior to versions 4.0.0-rc.2, 3.3.2, 2.71.13, and 2.70.14, vulnerability in ZITADEL's session management API allows any authenticated user to update a session if they know its ID, due to a missing permission check. This flaw enables session hijacking, allowing an attacker to impersonate another user and access sensitive resources. Versions prior to `2.53.0` are not affected, as they required the session token for updates. Versions 4.0.0-rc.2, 3.3.2, 2.71.13, and 2.70.14 fix the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-48795 - Apache CXF Unencrypted Temporary File Log Exposure Denial of Service</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48795
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Apache CXF stores large stream based messages as temporary files on the local filesystem. A bug was introduced which means that the entire temporary file is read into memory and then logged. An attacker might be able to exploit this to cause a denial of service attack by causing an out of memory exception. In addition, it is possible to configure CXF to encrypt temporary files to prevent sensitive credentials from being cached unencrypted on the local filesystem, however this bug means that the cached files are written out to logs unencrypted.

Users are recommended to upgrade to versions 3.5.11, 3.6.6, 4.0.7 or 4.1.1, which fixes this issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-53621 - DSpace XXE Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53621
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. Two related XML External Entity (XXE) injection possibilities impact all versions of DSpace prior to 7.6.4, 8.2, and 9.1. External entities are not disabled when parsing XML files during import of an archive (in Simple Archive Format), either from command-line (`./dspace import` command) or from the "Batch Import (Zip)" user interface feature. External entities are also not explicitly disabled when parsing XML responses from some upstream services (ArXiv, Crossref, OpenAIRE, Creative Commons) used in import from external sources via the user interface or REST API. An XXE injection in these files may result in a connection being made to an attacker's site or a local path readable by the Tomcat user, with content potentially being injected into a metadata field. In the latter case, this may result in sensitive content disclosure, including retrieving arbitrary files or configurations from the server where DSpace is running. The Simple Archive Format (SAF) importer / Batch Import (Zip) is only usable by site administrators (from user interface / REST API) or system administrators (from command-line). Therefore, to exploit this vulnerability, the malicious payload would have to be provided by an attacker and trusted by an administrator, who would trigger the import. The fix is included in DSpace 7.6.4, 8.2, and 9.1. Please upgrade to one of these versions. For those who cannot upgrade immediately, it is possible to manually patch the DSpace backend. One may also apply some best practices, though the protection provided is not as complete as upgrading. Administrators must carefully inspect any SAF archives (they did not construct themselves) before importing. As necessary, affected external services can be disabled to mitigate the ability for payloads to be delivered via external service APIs.

      <title>CVE-2025-53622 - DSpace Tomcat Path Traversal Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53622
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. Prior to versions 7.6.4, 8.2, and 9.1, a path traversal vulnerability is possible during the import of an archive (in Simple Archive Format), either from command-line (`./dspace import` command) or from the "Batch Import (Zip)" user interface feature. An attacker may craft a malicious Simple Archive Format (SAF) package where the `contents` file references any system files (using relative traversal sequences) which are readable by the Tomcat user.  If such a package is imported, this will result in sensitive content disclose, including retrieving arbitrary files or configurations from the server where DSpace is running. The Simple Archive Format (SAF) importer / Batch Import (Zip) is only usable by site administrators (from user interface / REST API) or system administrators (from command-line). Therefore, to exploit this vulnerability, the malicious payload would have to be provided by an attacker and trusted by an administrator (who would trigger the import). The fix is included in DSpace 7.6.4, 8.2 and 9.1. For those who cannot upgrade immediately, it is possible to manually patch the DSpace backend. (No changes are necessary to the frontend.)  A pull request exists which can be used to patch systems running DSpace 7.6.x, 8.x or 9.0. Although it is not possible to fully protect the system via workarounds, one may can apply a best practice. Administrators must carefully inspect any SAF archives (they did not construct themselves) before importing, paying close attention to the `contents` file to validate it does not reference files outside of the SAF archives.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53836
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 12 hours, 29 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>XWiki Rendering is a generic rendering system that converts textual input in a given syntax (wiki syntax, HTML, etc) into another syntax (XHTML, etc). Starting in version 4.2-milestone-1 and prior to versions 13.10.11, 14.4.7, and 14.10, the default macro content parser doesn't preserve the restricted attribute of the transformation context when executing nested macros. This allows executing macros that are normally forbidden in restricted mode, in particular script macros. The cache and chart macros that are bundled in XWiki use the vulnerable feature. This has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.7 and 14.10. To avoid the exploitation of this bug, comments can be disabled for untrusted users until an upgrade to a patched version has been performed. Note that users with edit rights will still be able to add comments via the object editor even if comments have been disabled.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53885
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 12 hours, 29 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, when using Directus Flows to handle CRUD events for users it is possible to log the incoming data to console using the "Log to Console" operation and a template string. Malicious admins can log sensitive data from other users when they are created or updated. Version 11.9.0 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, avoid logging sensitive data to the console outside the context of development.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 12 hours, 29 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.0.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, the exact Directus version number is incorrectly being used as OpenAPI Spec version this means that it is being exposed by the `/server/specs/oas` endpoint without authentication. With the exact version information a malicious attacker can look for known vulnerabilities in Directus core or any of its shipped dependencies in that specific running version. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-53889 - Directus Unauthenticated Flow Trigger Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53889
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 15, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 12 hours, 29 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Starting in version 9.12.0 and prior to version 11.9.0, Directus Flows with a manual trigger are not validating whether the user triggering the Flow has permissions to the items provided as payload to the Flow. Depending on what the Flow is set up to do this can lead to the Flow executing potential tasks on the attacker's behalf without authenticating. Bad actors could execute the manual trigger Flows without authentication, or access rights to the said collection(s) or item(s). Users with manual trigger Flows configured are impacted as these endpoints do not currently validate if the user has read access to `directus_flows` or to the relevant collection/items. The manual trigger Flows should have tighter security requirements as compared to webhook Flows where users are expected to perform do their own checks. Version 11.9.0 fixes the issue. As a workaround, implement permission checks for read access to Flows and read access to relevant collection/items.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53835
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 14, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 13 hours, 29 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>XWiki Rendering is a generic rendering system that converts textual input in a given syntax (wiki syntax, HTML, etc) into another syntax (XHTML, etc). Starting in version 5.4.5 and prior to version 14.10, the XHTML syntax depended on the `xdom+xml/current` syntax which allows the creation of raw blocks that permit the insertion of arbitrary HTML content including JavaScript. This allows XSS attacks for users who can edit a document like their user profile (enabled by default). This has been fixed in version 14.10 by removing the dependency on the `xdom+xml/current` syntax from the XHTML syntax. Note that the `xdom+xml` syntax is still vulnerable to this attack. As it's main purpose is testing and its use is quite difficult, this syntax shouldn't be installed or used on a regular wiki. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53640
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 14, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 8 hours, 9 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Indico is an event management system that uses Flask-Multipass, a multi-backend authentication system for Flask. Starting in version 2.2 and prior to version 3.3.7, an endpoint used to display details of users listed in certain fields (such as ACLs) could be misused to dump basic user details (such as name, affiliation and email) in bulk. Version 3.3.7 fixes the issue. Owners of instances that allow everyone to create a user account, who wish to truly restrict access to these user details, should consider restricting user search to managers. As a workaround, it is possible to restrict access to the affected endpoints (e.g. in the webserver config), but doing so would break certain form fields which could no longer show the details of the users listed in those fields, so upgrading instead is highly recommended.

      <title>CVE-2025-27582 - One Identity Password Manager Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-27582
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 14, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 27 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Secure Password extension in One Identity Password Manager before 5.14.4 allows local privilege escalation. The issue arises from a flawed security hardening mechanism within the kiosk browser used to display the Password Self-Service site to end users. Specifically, the application attempts to restrict privileged actions by overriding the native window.print() function. However, this protection can be bypassed by an attacker who accesses the Password Self-Service site from the lock screen and navigates to an attacker-controlled webpage via the Help function. By hosting a crafted web page with JavaScript, the attacker can restore and invoke the window.print() function, launching a SYSTEM-privileged print dialog. From this dialog, the attacker can exploit standard Windows functionality - such as the Print to PDF or Add Printer wizard - to spawn a command prompt with SYSTEM privileges. Successful exploitation allows a local attacker (with access to a locked workstation) to gain SYSTEM-level privileges, granting full control over the affected device.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-24294
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 12, 2025, 4:15 a.m. | 10 hours, 13 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The attack vector is a potential Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient check on the length of a decompressed domain name within a DNS packet.

An attacker can craft a malicious DNS packet containing a highly compressed domain name. When the resolv library parses such a packet, the name decompression process consumes a large amount of CPU resources, as the library does not limit the resulting length of the name.

This resource consumption can cause the application thread to become unresponsive, resulting in a Denial of Service condition.

      <title>CVE-2024-47065 - Meshtastic Traceroute Rate Limiting Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-47065
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 11, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 13 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Meshtastic is an open source mesh networking solution. Prior to 2.5.1, traceroute responses from the remote node are not rate limited. Given that there are SNR measurements attributed to each received transmission, this is a guaranteed way to get a remote station to reliably and continuously respond. You could easily get 100 samples in a short amount of time (estimated 2 minutes), whereas passively doing the same could take hours or days. There are secondary effects that non-ratelimited traceroute does also allow a 2:1 reflected DoS of the network as well, but these concerns are less than the problem with positional confidentiality (other DoS routes exist). This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-43856 - Immich OAuth2 CSRF Account Hijacking Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-43856
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 11, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 13 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>immich is a high performance self-hosted photo and video management solution. Prior to 1.132.0, immich is vulnerable to account hijacking through oauth2, because the state parameter is not being checked. The oauth2 state parameter is similar to a csrf token, so when the user starts the login flow this unpredictable token is generated and somehow saved in the browser session and passed to the identity provider, which will return the state parameter when redirecting the user back to immich. Before the user is logged in that parameter needs to be verified to make sure the login was actively initiated by the user in this browser session. On it's own, this wouldn't be too bad, but when immich uses the /user-settings page as a redirect_uri, it will automatically link the accounts if the user was already logged in. This means that if someone has an immich instance with a public oauth provider (like google), an attacker can - for example - embed a hidden iframe in a webpage or even just send the victim a forged oauth login url with a code that logs the victim into the attackers oauth account and redirects back to immich and links the accounts. After this, the attacker can log into the victims account using their own oauth credentials. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.132.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-45582 - Apache GNU Tar Directory Traversal Overwrite Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-45582
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 11, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 13 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>GNU Tar through 1.35 allows file overwrite via directory traversal in crafted TAR archives, with a certain two-step process. First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of "Member name contains '..'" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain "x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which "tar xf" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages).

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 11, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in the Software SMI handler (SwSmiInputValue 0xB2) allows a local attacker to control both the read and write addresses used by the CommandRcx1 function. The write target is derived from an unvalidated UEFI NVRAM variable (SetupXtuBufferAddress), while the write content is read from an attacker-controlled pointer based on the RBX register. This dual-pointer dereference enables arbitrary memory writes within System Management RAM (SMRAM), leading to potential SMM privilege escalation and firmware compromise.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7028
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 11, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in the Software SMI handler (SwSmiInputValue 0x20) allows a local attacker to supply a crafted pointer (FuncBlock) through RBX and RCX register values. This pointer is passed unchecked into multiple flash management functions (ReadFlash, WriteFlash, EraseFlash, and GetFlashInfo) that dereference both the structure and its nested members, such as BufAddr. This enables arbitrary read/write access to System Management RAM (SMRAM), allowing an attacker to corrupt firmware memory, exfiltrate SMRAM content via flash, or install persistent implants.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-52948
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 11, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker, in rare cases, sending specific, unknown traffic patterns to cause the FPC and system to crash and restart.

BPF provides a raw interface to data link layers in a protocol independent fashion. Internally within the Junos kernel, due to a rare timing issue (race condition), when a BPF instance is cloned, the newly created interface causes an internal structure leakage, leading to a system crash. The precise content and timing of the traffic patterns is indeterminate, but has been seen in a lab environment multiple times.

This issue is more likely to occur when packet capturing is enabled.  See required configuration below.

This issue affects Junos OS: 



  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9, 
  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10, 
  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6,

      <title>CVE-2025-34098 - Riverbed SteelHead VCX Path Traversal Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34098
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 1 minute ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A path traversal vulnerability exists in Riverbed SteelHead VCX appliances (confirmed in VCX255U 9.6.0a) due to improper input validation in the log filtering functionality exposed via the management web interface. An authenticated attacker can exploit this flaw by submitting crafted filter expressions to the log_filter endpoint using the filterStr parameter. This input is processed by a backend parser that permits execution of file expansion syntax, allowing the attacker to retrieve arbitrary system files via the log viewing interface.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34099
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 1 minute ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unauthenticated command injection vulnerability exists in VICIdial versions 2.9 RC1 through 2.13 RC1, within the vicidial_sales_viewer.php component when password encryption is enabled (a non-default configuration). The application improperly passes the HTTP Basic Authentication password directly to a call to exec() without adequate sanitation. This allows remote attackers to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands as the web server user.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34100
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 1 minute ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unrestricted file upload vulnerability exists in BuilderEngine 3.5.0 via the integration of the elFinder 2.0 file manager and its use of the jQuery File Upload plugin. The plugin fails to properly validate or restrict file types or locations during upload operations, allowing an attacker to upload a malicious .php file and subsequently execute arbitrary PHP code on the server under the context of the web server process. While the root vulnerability lies within the jQuery File Upload component, BuilderEngine’s improper integration and lack of access controls expose this functionality to unauthenticated users, resulting in full remote code execution.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34102
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 1 minute ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in CryptoLog (PHP version, discontinued since 2009) due to a chained exploitation of SQL injection and command injection vulnerabilities. An unauthenticated attacker can gain shell access as the web server user by first exploiting a SQL injection flaw in login.php to bypass authentication, followed by command injection in logshares_ajax.php to execute arbitrary operating system commands.


The login bypass is achieved by submitting crafted SQL via the user POST parameter. Once authenticated, the attacker can abuse the lsid POST parameter in the logshares_ajax.php endpoint to inject and execute a command using $(...) syntax, resulting in code execution under the web context.


This exploitation path does not exist in the ASP.NET version of CryptoLog released since 2009.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53709
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Secure-upload is a data submission service that validates single-use tokens when accepting submissions to channels. The service only installed on a small number of environments.

Under specific circumstances, privileged users of secure-upload could have selected email templates not necessarily created for their enrollment when sending data upload requests.
Authenticated and privileged users of one enrollment could have abused an endpoint to redirect existing submission channels to a dataset they control.
An endpoint handling domain validation allowed unauthenticated users to enumerate existing enrollments.
Finally, other endpoints allowed enumerating if a resource with a known RID exists across enrollments.

The affected service has been patched with version 0.815.0 and automatically deployed to all Apollo-managed Foundry instances.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53542
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Headlamp is an extensible Kubernetes web UI. A command injection vulnerability was discovered in the codeSign.js script used in the macOS packaging workflow of the Kubernetes Headlamp project. This issue arises due to the improper use of Node.js's execSync() function with unsanitized input derived from environment variables, which can be influenced by an attacker. The variables ${teamID}, ${entitlementsPath}, and ${config.app} are dynamically derived from the environment or application config and passed directly to the shell command without proper escaping or argument separation. This exposes the system to command injection if any of the values contain malicious input. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.31.1.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Matrix Rust SDK is a collection of libraries that make it easier to build Matrix clients in Rust. An SQL injection vulnerability in the EventCache::find_event_with_relations method of matrix-sdk 0.11 and 0.12 allows malicious room members to execute arbitrary SQL commands in Matrix clients that directly pass relation types provided by those room members into this method, when used with the default sqlite-based store backend. Exploitation is unlikely, as no known clients currently use the API in this manner. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.13.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>DiscordNotifications is an extension for MediaWiki that sends notifications of actions in your Wiki to a Discord channel. DiscordNotifications allows sending requests via curl and file_get_contents to arbitrary URLs set via $wgDiscordIncomingWebhookUrl and $wgDiscordAdditionalIncomingWebhookUrls. This allows for DOS by causing the server to read large files. SSRF is also possible if there are internal unprotected APIs that can be accessed using HTTP POST requests, which could also possibly lead to RCE. This vulnerability is fixed in commit 1f20d850cbcce5b15951c7c6127b87b927a5415e.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>SSRF in Apache HTTP Server with mod_proxy loaded allows an attacker to send outbound proxy requests to a URL controlled by the attacker.  Requires an unlikely configuration where mod_headers is configured to modify the Content-Type request or response header with a value provided in the HTTP request.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64 which fixes this issue.

      <title>CVE-2024-43394 - Apache HTTP Server Windows SSRF NTLM Hash Leak</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-43394
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Apache HTTP Server on Windows allows to potentially leak NTLM hashes to a malicious server via 
mod_rewrite or apache expressions that pass unvalidated request input.

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.0 through 2.4.63.

Note:  The Apache HTTP Server Project will be setting a higher bar for accepting vulnerability reports regarding SSRF via UNC paths. 

The server offers limited protection against administrators directing the server to open UNC paths.
Windows servers should limit the hosts they will connect over via SMB based on the nature of NTLM authentication.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-47252
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Insufficient escaping of user-supplied data in mod_ssl in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.63 and earlier allows an untrusted SSL/TLS client to insert escape characters into log files in some configurations.

In a logging configuration where CustomLog is used with "%{varname}x" or "%{varname}c" to log variables provided by mod_ssl such as SSL_TLS_SNI, no escaping is performed by either mod_log_config or mod_ssl and unsanitized data provided by the client may appear in log files.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-23048
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In some mod_ssl configurations on Apache HTTP Server 2.4.35 through to 2.4.63, an access control bypass by trusted clients is possible using TLS 1.3 session resumption.

Configurations are affected when mod_ssl is configured for multiple virtual hosts, with each restricted to a different set of trusted client certificates (for example with a different SSLCACertificateFile/Path setting). In such a case, a client trusted to access one virtual host may be able to access another virtual host, if SSLStrictSNIVHostCheck is not enabled in either virtual host.

      <title>CVE-2025-47811 - Wing FTP Server Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47811
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In Wing FTP Server through 7.4.4, the administrative web interface (listening by default on port 5466) runs as root or SYSTEM by default. The web application itself offers several legitimate ways to execute arbitrary system commands (i.e., through the web console or the task scheduler), and they are automatically executed in the highest possible privilege context. Because administrative users of the web interface are not necessarily also system administrators, one might argue that this is a privilege escalation. (If a privileged application role is not available to an attacker, CVE-2025-47812 can be leveraged.) NOTE: the vendor reportedly considers this behavior "fine to keep."

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In Wing FTP Server before 7.4.4. the user and admin web interfaces mishandle '\0' bytes, ultimately allowing injection of arbitrary Lua code into user session files. This can be used to execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the FTP service (root or SYSTEM by default). This is thus a remote code execution vulnerability that guarantees a total server compromise. This is also exploitable via anonymous FTP accounts.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53364
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Starting in 5.3.0 and before 7.5.3 and 8.2.2, the Parse Server GraphQL API previously allowed public access to the GraphQL schema without requiring a session token or the master key. While schema introspection reveals only metadata and not actual data, this metadata can still expand the potential attack surface. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.5.3 and 8.2.2.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Gitk is a Tcl/Tk based Git history browser. Starting with 2.41.0, a Git repository can be crafted in such a way that with some social engineering a user who has cloned the repository can be tricked into running any script (e.g., Bourne shell, Perl, Python, ...) supplied by the attacker by invoking gitk filename, where filename has a particular structure. The script is run with the privileges of the user. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.43.7, 2.44.4, 2.45.4, 2.46.4, 2.47.3, 2.48.2, 2.49.1, and 2.50.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6211
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in the DocugamiReader class of the run-llama/llama_index repository, up to version 0.12.28, involves the use of MD5 hashing to generate IDs for document chunks. This approach leads to hash collisions when structurally distinct chunks contain identical text, resulting in one chunk overwriting another. This can cause loss of semantically or legally important document content, breakage of parent-child chunk hierarchies, and inaccurate or hallucinated responses in AI outputs. The issue is resolved in version 0.3.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-38335 - Linux Kernel gpio-keys Soft Lockup Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38335
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: gpio-keys - fix a sleep while atomic with PREEMPT_RT

When enabling PREEMPT_RT, the gpio_keys_irq_timer() callback runs in
hard irq context, but the input_event() takes a spin_lock, which isn't
allowed there as it is converted to a rt_spin_lock().

[ 4054.289999] BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c:48
[ 4054.290028] in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 1, non_block: 0, pid: 0, name: swapper/0

[ 4054.290316]  gic_handle_irq+0x44/0xcc

Considering the gpio_keys_irq_isr() can run in any context, e.g. it can
be threaded, it seems there's no point in requesting the timer isr to
run in hard irq context.

Relax the hrtimer not to use the hard context.

In this case, the system hangs when reading the ATIP from optical media
with cdrecord -vvv -atip on an _NEC DVD_RW ND-4571A 1-01 and an
Optiarc DVD RW AD-7200A 1.06 attached to an ASRock 990FX Extreme 4,
running at UDMA/33.

The issue can be reproduced by running the same command with a cygwin
build of cdrecord on WinXP, although it requires more attempts to cause
it. The hang in that case is also resolved by forcing PIO. It doesn't
appear that VIA has produced any drivers for that OS, thus no known
workaround exists.

HDDs attached to the controller do not suffer from any DMA issues.

      <title>CVE-2025-38337 - Linux Kernel jbd2 Null Pointer Dereference and Data Race Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38337
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jbd2: fix data-race and null-ptr-deref in jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata()

Since handle->h_transaction may be a NULL pointer, so we should change it
to call is_handle_aborted(handle) first before dereferencing it.

And the following data-race was reported in my fuzzer:

==================================================================

This issue is caused by missing data-race annotation for jh->b_modified.
Therefore, the missing annotation needs to be added.

      <title>CVE-2025-38338 - "NFS Linux Kernel Deadlock and Unlocked Folio Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38338
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/nfs/read: fix double-unlock bug in nfs_return_empty_folio()

Sometimes, when a file was read while it was being truncated by
another NFS client, the kernel could deadlock because folio_unlock()
was called twice, and the second call would XOR back the `PG_locked`
flag.

Most of the time (depending on the timing of the truncation), nobody
notices the problem because folio_unlock() gets called three times,
which flips `PG_locked` back off:

 1. vfs_read, nfs_read_folio, ... nfs_read_add_folio,
    nfs_return_empty_folio
 2. vfs_read, nfs_read_folio, ... netfs_read_collection,
    netfs_unlock_abandoned_read_pages
 3. vfs_read, ... nfs_do_read_folio, nfs_read_add_folio,
    nfs_return_empty_folio

The problem is that nfs_read_add_folio() is not supposed to unlock the
folio if fscache is enabled, and a nfs_netfs_folio_unlock() check is
missing in nfs_return_empty_folio().

Rarely this leads to a warning in netfs_read_collection():

 ------------[ cut here ]------------
 R=0000031c: folio 10 is not locked
 WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 29 at fs/netfs/read_collect.c:133 netfs_read_collection+0x7c0/0xf00

Most of the time, however, processes just get stuck forever in
folio_wait_bit_common(), waiting for `PG_locked` to disappear, which
never happens because nobody is really holding the folio lock.

      <title>CVE-2025-38339 - Linux Kernel PowerPC BPF Trampoline JIT Code Size Calculation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38339
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/bpf: fix JIT code size calculation of bpf trampoline

arch_bpf_trampoline_size() provides JIT size of the BPF trampoline
before the buffer for JIT'ing it is allocated. The total number of
instructions emitted for BPF trampoline JIT code depends on where
the final image is located. So, the size arrived at with the dummy
pass in arch_bpf_trampoline_size() can vary from the actual size
needed in  arch_prepare_bpf_trampoline().  When the instructions
accounted in  arch_bpf_trampoline_size() is less than the number of
instructions emitted during the actual JIT compile of the trampoline,
the below warning is produced:

  WARNING: CPU: 8 PID: 204190 at arch/powerpc/net/bpf_jit_comp.c:981 __arch_prepare_bpf_trampoline.isra.0+0xd2c/0xdcc

which is:

  /* Make sure the trampoline generation logic doesn't overflow */
  if (image && WARN_ON_ONCE(&image[ctx->idx] >
  			(u32 *)rw_image_end - BPF_INSN_SAFETY)) {

So, during the dummy pass, instead of providing some arbitrary image
location, account for maximum possible instructions if and when there
is a dependency with image location for JIT'ing.

software node: Correct a OOB check in software_node_get_reference_args()

software_node_get_reference_args() wants to get @index-th element, so
the property value requires at least '(index + 1) * sizeof(*ref)' bytes

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPICA: fix acpi parse and parseext cache leaks

ACPICA commit 8829e70e1360c81e7a5a901b5d4f48330e021ea5

I'm Seunghun Han, and I work for National Security Research Institute of
South Korea.

I have been doing a research on ACPI and found an ACPI cache leak in ACPI
early abort cases.

Boot log of ACPI cache leak is as follows:

I analyzed this memory leak in detail. I found that “Acpi-State” cache and
“Acpi-Parse” cache were merged because the size of cache objects was same
slab cache size.

I finally found “Acpi-Parse” cache and “Acpi-parse_ext” cache were leaked
using SLAB_NEVER_MERGE flag in kmem_cache_create() function.

ACPICA commit 987a3b5cf7175916e2a4b6ea5b8e70f830dfe732

I found an ACPI cache leak in ACPI early termination and boot continuing case.

When early termination occurs due to malicious ACPI table, Linux kernel
terminates ACPI function and continues to boot process. While kernel terminates
ACPI function, kmem_cache_destroy() reports Acpi-Operand cache leak.

I analyzed this memory leak in detail and found acpi_ds_obj_stack_pop_and_
delete() function miscalculated the top of the stack. acpi_ds_obj_stack_push()
function uses walk_state->operand_index for start position of the top, but
acpi_ds_obj_stack_pop_and_delete() function considers index 0 for it.
Therefore, this causes acpi operand memory leak.

This cache leak causes a security threat because an old kernel (<= 4.9) shows
memory locations of kernel functions in stack dump. Some malicious users
could use this information to neutralize kernel ASLR.

I made a patch to fix ACPI operand cache leak.

The above issue may happen as follows:
(1) Add kprobe tracepoint;
(2) insmod test.ko;
(3)  Module triggers ftrace disabled;
(4) rmmod test.ko;
(5) cat /proc/kallsyms; --> Will trigger UAF as test.ko already removed;
ftrace_mod_get_kallsym()
...
strscpy(module_name, mod_map->mod->name, MODULE_NAME_LEN);
...

The problem is when a module triggers an issue with ftrace and
sets ftrace_disable. The ftrace_disable is set when an anomaly is
discovered and to prevent any more damage, ftrace stops all text
modification. The issue that happened was that the ftrace_disable stops
more than just the text modification.

When a module is loaded, its init functions can also be traced. Because
kallsyms deletes the init functions after a module has loaded, ftrace
saves them when the module is loaded and function tracing is enabled. This
allows the output of the function trace to show the init function names
instead of just their raw memory addresses.

When a module is removed, ftrace_release_mod() is called, and if
ftrace_disable is set, it just returns without doing anything more. The
problem here is that it leaves the mod_list still around and if kallsyms
is called, it will call into this code and access the module memory that
has already been freed as it will return:

  strscpy(module_name, mod_map->mod->name, MODULE_NAME_LEN);

Where the "mod" no longer exists and triggers a UAF bug.

So that, during mknod in the corrupted directory, it tries to get and
lock inode page twice, result in deadlock.

        - __get_node_page --- try to lock dir's inode page

In order to fix this, let's add sanity check on ino and xnid.

      <title>CVE-2025-38348 - "Intersil p54 WiFi Interface Buffer Overflow Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38348
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: p54: prevent buffer-overflow in p54_rx_eeprom_readback()

Robert Morris reported:

|If a malicious USB device pretends to be an Intersil p54 wifi
|interface and generates an eeprom_readback message with a large
|eeprom->v1.len, p54_rx_eeprom_readback() will copy data from the
|message beyond the end of priv->eeprom.
|
|static void p54_rx_eeprom_readback(struct p54_common *priv,
|                                   struct sk_buff *skb)
|{
|        struct p54_hdr *hdr = (struct p54_hdr *) skb->data;
|        struct p54_eeprom_lm86 *eeprom = (struct p54_eeprom_lm86 *) hdr->data;
|
|        if (priv->fw_var >= 0x509) {
|                memcpy(priv->eeprom, eeprom->v2.data,
|                       le16_to_cpu(eeprom->v2.len));
|        } else {
|                memcpy(priv->eeprom, eeprom->v1.data,
|                       le16_to_cpu(eeprom->v1.len));
|        }
| [...]

The eeprom->v{1,2}.len is set by the driver in p54_download_eeprom().
The device is supposed to provide the same length back to the driver.
But yes, it's possible (like shown in the report) to alter the value
to something that causes a crash/panic due to overrun.

This patch addresses the issue by adding the size to the common device
context, so p54_rx_eeprom_readback no longer relies on possibly tampered
values... That said, it also checks if the "firmware" altered the value
and no longer copies them.

The one, small saving grace is: Before the driver tries to read the eeprom,
it needs to upload >a< firmware. the vendor firmware has a proprietary
license and as a reason, it is not present on most distributions by
default.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Use memcpy() for BIOS version

The strlcat() with FORTIFY support is triggering a panic because it
thinks the target buffer will overflow although the correct target
buffer size is passed in.

Anyway, instead of memset() with 0 followed by a strlcat(), just use
memcpy() and ensure that the resulting buffer is NULL terminated.

BIOSVersion is only used for the lpfc_printf_log() which expects a
properly terminated string.

      <title>CVE-2025-38334 - Linux Kernel SGX: Poisoned Page Reclaimer Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38334
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/sgx: Prevent attempts to reclaim poisoned pages

TL;DR: SGX page reclaim touches the page to copy its contents to
secondary storage. SGX instructions do not gracefully handle machine
checks. Despite this, the existing SGX code will try to reclaim pages
that it _knows_ are poisoned. Avoid even trying to reclaim poisoned pages.

The longer story:

Pages used by an enclave only get epc_page->poison set in
arch_memory_failure() but they currently stay on sgx_active_page_list until
sgx_encl_release(), with the SGX_EPC_PAGE_RECLAIMER_TRACKED flag untouched.

epc_page->poison is not checked in the reclaimer logic meaning that, if other
conditions are met, an attempt will be made to reclaim an EPC page that was
poisoned.  This is bad because 1. we don't want that page to end up added
to another enclave and 2. it is likely to cause one core to shut down
and the kernel to panic.

Specifically, reclaiming uses microcode operations including "EWB" which
accesses the EPC page contents to encrypt and write them out to non-SGX
memory.  Those operations cannot handle MCEs in their accesses other than
by putting the executing core into a special shutdown state (affecting
both threads with HT.)  The kernel will subsequently panic on the
remaining cores seeing the core didn't enter MCE handler(s) in time.

Call sgx_unmark_page_reclaimable() to remove the affected EPC page from
sgx_active_page_list on memory error to stop it being considered for
reclaiming.

Testing epc_page->poison in sgx_reclaim_pages() would also work but I assume
it's better to add code in the less likely paths.

The affected EPC page is not added to &node->sgx_poison_page_list until
later in sgx_encl_release()->sgx_free_epc_page() when it is EREMOVEd.
Membership on other lists doesn't change to avoid changing any of the
lists' semantics except for sgx_active_page_list.  There's a "TBD" comment
in arch_memory_failure() about pre-emptive actions, the goal here is not
to address everything that it may imply.

This also doesn't completely close the time window when a memory error
notification will be fatal (for a not previously poisoned EPC page) --
the MCE can happen after sgx_reclaim_pages() has selected its candidates
or even *inside* a microcode operation (actually easy to trigger due to
the amount of time spent in them.)

The spinlock in sgx_unmark_page_reclaimable() is safe because
memory_failure() runs in process context and no spinlocks are held,
explicitly noted in a mm/memory-failure.c comment.

      <title>CVE-2025-38330 - Linux Kernel Firmware cs_dsp Out-of-Bounds Memory Read Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38330
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: cs_dsp: Fix OOB memory read access in KUnit test (ctl cache)

KASAN reported out of bounds access - cs_dsp_ctl_cache_init_multiple_offsets().
The code uses mock_coeff_template.length_bytes (4 bytes) for register value
allocations. But later, this length is set to 8 bytes which causes
test code failures.

As fix, just remove the lenght override, keeping the original value 4
for all operations.

      <title>CVE-2025-38331 - "Cortina Ethernet NetEngine TCP Offload Engine Segmentation Quirk"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38331
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 10, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: cortina: Use TOE/TSO on all TCP

It is desireable to push the hardware accelerator to also
process non-segmented TCP frames: we pass the skb->len
to the "TOE/TSO" offloader and it will handle them.

Without this quirk the driver becomes unstable and lock
up and and crash.

I do not know exactly why, but it is probably due to the
TOE (TCP offload engine) feature that is coupled with the
segmentation feature - it is not possible to turn one
part off and not the other, either both TOE and TSO are
active, or neither of them.

Not having the TOE part active seems detrimental, as if
that hardware feature is not really supposed to be turned
off.

The datasheet says:

  "Based on packet parsing and TCP connection/NAT table
   lookup results, the NetEngine puts the packets
   belonging to the same TCP connection to the same queue
   for the software to process. The NetEngine puts
   incoming packets to the buffer or series of buffers
   for a jumbo packet. With this hardware acceleration,
   IP/TCP header parsing, checksum validation and
   connection lookup are offloaded from the software
   processing."

After numerous tests with the hardware locking up after
something between minutes and hours depending on load
using iperf3 I have concluded this is necessary to stabilize
the hardware.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53546
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Folo organizes feeds content into one timeline. Using pull_request_target on .github/workflows/auto-fix-lint-format-commit.yml can be exploited by attackers, since untrusted code can be executed having full access to secrets (from the base repo). By exploiting the vulnerability is possible to exfiltrate GITHUB_TOKEN which has high privileges. GITHUB_TOKEN can be used to completely overtake the repo since the token has content write privileges. This vulnerability is fixed in commit 585c6a591440cd39f92374230ac5d65d7dd23d6a.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7204
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In ConnectWise PSA versions older than 2025.9, a
vulnerability exists where authenticated users could gain access to sensitive
user information. Specific API requests were found to return an overly verbose
user object, which included encrypted password hashes for other users.
Authenticated users could then retrieve these hashes. 



An
attacker or privileged user could then use these exposed hashes to conduct
offline brute-force or dictionary attacks. Such attacks could lead to
credential compromise, allowing unauthorized access to accounts, and
potentially privilege escalation within the system.

      <title>CVE-2025-38247 - "Linux Kernel User Namespace and Mnt Idmap Leak"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38247
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

userns and mnt_idmap leak in open_tree_attr(2)

Once want_mount_setattr() has returned a positive, it does require
finish_mount_kattr() to release ->mnt_userns.  Failing do_mount_setattr()
does not change that.

As the result, we can end up leaking userns and possibly mnt_idmap as
well.

      <title>CVE-2025-38248 - Linux Kernel Bridge Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38248
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration

The bridge maintains a global list of ports behind which a multicast
router resides. The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure
multicast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not
member in the matching MDB entry.

When per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast
context is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global
router port list:

 # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1
 # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy
 # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2
 $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router
 router ports on br1: dummy1
 # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1
 $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router

However, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN
multicast snooping is enabled:

 # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0
 # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2
 $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router
 router ports on br1: dummy1

Since commit 4b30ae9adb04 ("net: bridge: mcast: re-implement
br_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions"), when per-VLAN multicast
snooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the
per-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a
result, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it
is deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is
traversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):

 # ip link del dev dummy1
 # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy
 # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2

Similarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port
list. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}
contexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the
per-VLAN router port list:

 # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1
 # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy
 # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1
 # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1
 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2
 $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router
       router ports: dummy1
 # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0
 $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router

However, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when
per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:

 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0
 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2
 $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router
       router ports: dummy1

When the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast
context will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled
on the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router
port list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead
to a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new
port to the list, for example):

 # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy
 # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2
 # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1
 # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2

Fix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or
per-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The
function is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast
context and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast
context.

Note that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only
takes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the
permanent one (2).

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38249
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix out-of-bounds read in snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3()

In snd_usb_get_audioformat_uac3(), the length value returned from
snd_usb_ctl_msg() is used directly for memory allocation without
validation. This length is controlled by the USB device.

The allocated buffer is cast to a uac3_cluster_header_descriptor
and its fields are accessed without verifying that the buffer
is large enough. If the device returns a smaller than expected
length, this leads to an out-of-bounds read.

Add a length check to ensure the buffer is large enough for
uac3_cluster_header_descriptor.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38250
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_core: Fix use-after-free in vhci_flush()

syzbot reported use-after-free in vhci_flush() without repro. [0]

From the splat, a thread close()d a vhci file descriptor while
its device was being used by iotcl() on another thread.

Once the last fd refcnt is released, vhci_release() calls
hci_unregister_dev(), hci_free_dev(), and kfree() for struct
vhci_data, which is set to hci_dev->dev->driver_data.

The problem is that there is no synchronisation after unlinking
hdev from hci_dev_list in hci_unregister_dev().  There might be
another thread still accessing the hdev which was fetched before
the unlink operation.

We can use SRCU for such synchronisation.

Let's run hci_dev_reset() under SRCU and wait for its completion
in hci_unregister_dev().

Another option would be to restore hci_dev->destruct(), which was
removed in commit 587ae086f6e4 ("Bluetooth: Remove unused
hci-destruct cb").  However, this would not be a good solution, as
we should not run hci_unregister_dev() while there are in-flight
ioctl() requests, which could lead to another data-race KCSAN splat.

Note that other drivers seem to have the same problem, for exmaple,
virtbt_remove().

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38252
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl/ras: Fix CPER handler device confusion

By inspection, cxl_cper_handle_prot_err() is making a series of fragile
assumptions that can lead to crashes:

1/ It assumes that endpoints identified in the record are a CXL-type-3
   device, nothing guarantees that.

2/ It assumes that the device is bound to the cxl_pci driver, nothing
   guarantees that.

3/ Minor, it holds the device lock over the switch-port tracing for no
   reason as the trace is 100% generated from data in the record.

Correct those by checking that the PCIe endpoint parents a cxl_memdev
before assuming the format of the driver data, and move the lock to where
it is required. Consequently this also makes the implementation ready for
CXL accelerators that are not bound to cxl_pci.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38253
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: wacom: fix crash in wacom_aes_battery_handler()

Commit fd2a9b29dc9c ("HID: wacom: Remove AES power_supply after extended
inactivity") introduced wacom_aes_battery_handler() which is scheduled
as a delayed work (aes_battery_work).

In wacom_remove(), aes_battery_work is not canceled. Consequently, if
the device is removed while aes_battery_work is still pending, then hard
crashes or "Oops: general protection fault..." are experienced when
wacom_aes_battery_handler() is finally called. E.g., this happens with
built-in USB devices after resume from hibernate when aes_battery_work
was still pending at the time of hibernation.

So, take care to cancel aes_battery_work in wacom_remove().

      <title>CVE-2025-38254 - AMD Linux Kernel EDID Handling Buffer Overflow</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38254
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Add sanity checks for drm_edid_raw()

When EDID is retrieved via drm_edid_raw(), it doesn't guarantee to
return proper EDID bytes the caller wants: it may be either NULL (that
leads to an Oops) or with too long bytes over the fixed size raw_edid
array (that may lead to memory corruption).  The latter was reported
actually when connected with a bad adapter.

Add sanity checks for drm_edid_raw() to address the above corner
cases, and return EDID_BAD_INPUT accordingly.

(cherry picked from commit 648d3f4d209725d51900d6a3ed46b7b600140cdf)

Root cause is that numgrps is set to 0, and ZERO_SIZE_PTR is returned from

Fix the problem by checking numgrps first in group_cpus_evenly(), and
return NULL directly if numgrps is zero.

We can pin a tail page of a folio, but then io_uring will try to unpin
the head page of the folio. While it should be fine in terms of keeping
the page actually alive, mm folks say it's wrong and triggers a debug
warning. Use unpin_user_folio() instead of unpin_user_page*.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38257
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/pkey: Prevent overflow in size calculation for memdup_user()

Number of apqn target list entries contained in 'nr_apqns' variable is
determined by userspace via an ioctl call so the result of the product in
calculation of size passed to memdup_user() may overflow.

In this case the actual size of the allocated area and the value
describing it won't be in sync leading to various types of unpredictable
behaviour later.

Use a proper memdup_array_user() helper which returns an error if an
overflow is detected. Note that it is different from when nr_apqns is
initially zero - that case is considered valid and should be handled in
subsequent pkey_handler implementations.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org).

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/damon/sysfs-schemes: free old damon_sysfs_scheme_filter->memcg_path on write

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: codecs: wcd9335: Fix missing free of regulator supplies

Driver gets and enables all regulator supplies in probe path
(wcd9335_parse_dt() and wcd9335_power_on_reset()), but does not cleanup
in final error paths and in unbind (missing remove() callback).  This
leads to leaked memory and unbalanced regulator enable count during
probe errors or unbind.

Fix this by converting entire code into devm_regulator_bulk_get_enable()
which also greatly simplifies the code.

[CAUSE]
Firstly the fs has a corrupted csum tree root, thus to mount the fs we
have to go "ro,rescue=ibadroots" mount option.

Normally with that mount option, a bad csum tree root should set
BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS flag, so that any future data read will
ignore csum search.

But in this particular case, we have the following call trace that
caused NULL csum root, but not setting BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS:

load_global_roots_objectid():

		ret = btrfs_search_slot();
		/* Succeeded */
		btrfs_item_key_to_cpu()
		found = true;
		/* We found the root item for csum tree. */
		root = read_tree_root_path();
		if (IS_ERR(root)) {
			if (!btrfs_test_opt(fs_info, IGNOREBADROOTS))
			/*
			 * Since we have rescue=ibadroots mount option,
			 * @ret is still 0.
			 */
			break;
	if (!found || ret) {
		/* @found is true, @ret is 0, error handling for csum
		 * tree is skipped.
		 */
	}

This means we completely skipped to set BTRFS_FS_STATE_NO_DATA_CSUMS if
the csum tree is corrupted, which results unexpected later csum lookup.

[FIX]
If read_tree_root_path() failed, always populate @ret to the error
number.

As at the end of the function, we need @ret to determine if we need to
do the extra error handling for csum tree.

      <title>CVE-2025-38261 - Linux RISC-V SR_SUM Status Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38261
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: save the SR_SUM status over switches

When threads/tasks are switched we need to ensure the old execution's
SR_SUM state is saved and the new thread has the old SR_SUM state
restored.

The issue was seen under heavy load especially with the syz-stress tool
running, with crashes as follows in schedule_tail:

Unable to handle kernel access to user memory without uaccess routines
at virtual address 000000002749f0d0

---[ end trace b5f8f9231dc87dda ]---

The issue comes from the put_user() in schedule_tail
(kernel/sched/core.c) doing the following:

asmlinkage __visible void schedule_tail(struct task_struct *prev)
{
...
        if (current->set_child_tid)
                put_user(task_pid_vnr(current), current->set_child_tid);
...
}

the put_user() macro causes the code sequence to come out as follows:

1:	__enable_user_access()
2:	reg = task_pid_vnr(current);
3:	*current->set_child_tid = reg;
4:	__disable_user_access()

The problem is that we may have a sleeping function as argument which
could clear SR_SUM causing the panic above. This was fixed by
evaluating the argument of the put_user() macro outside the user-enabled
section in commit 285a76bb2cf5 ("riscv: evaluate put_user() arg before
enabling user access")"

In order for riscv to take advantage of unsafe_get/put_XXX() macros and
to avoid the same issue we had with put_user() and sleeping functions we
must ensure code flow can go through switch_to() from within a region of
code with SR_SUM enabled and come back with SR_SUM still enabled. This
patch addresses the problem allowing future work to enable full use of
unsafe_get/put_XXX() macros without needing to take a CSR bit flip cost
on every access. Make switch_to() save and restore SR_SUM.

      <title>CVE-2025-38262 - Linux UARTlite Concurrency Race Null Pointer Dereference</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38262
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: serial: uartlite: register uart driver in init

When two instances of uart devices are probing, a concurrency race can
occur. If one thread calls uart_register_driver function, which first
allocates and assigns memory to 'uart_state' member of uart_driver
structure, the other instance can bypass uart driver registration and
call ulite_assign. This calls uart_add_one_port, which expects the uart
driver to be fully initialized. This leads to a kernel panic due to a
null pointer dereference:

To prevent it, move uart driver registration in to init function. This
will ensure that uart_driver is always registered when probe function
is called.

The reason is simple, readahead brought some order 0 folio in swap cache,
and the swapin mTHP folio being allocated is in conflict with it, so
swapcache_prepare fails and causes shmem_swap_alloc_folio to return
-EEXIST, and shmem simply retries again and again causing this loop.

Fix it by applying a similar fix for anon mTHP swapin.

The performance change is very slight, time of swapin 10g zero folios
with shmem (test for 12 times):
Before:  2.47s
After:   2.48s

      <title>CVE-2025-38242 - Linux Kernel Userfaultfd Swap Cache Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38242
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: userfaultfd: fix race of userfaultfd_move and swap cache

This commit fixes two kinds of races, they may have different results:

Barry reported a BUG_ON in commit c50f8e6053b0, we may see the same
BUG_ON if the filemap lookup returned NULL and folio is added to swap
cache after that.

If another kind of race is triggered (folio changed after lookup) we
may see RSS counter is corrupted:

[  406.893936] BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:ffff0000c5a9ddc0
type:MM_ANONPAGES val:-1
[  406.894071] BUG: Bad rss-counter state mm:ffff0000c5a9ddc0
type:MM_SHMEMPAGES val:1

Because the folio is being accounted to the wrong VMA.

I'm not sure if there will be any data corruption though, seems no. 
The issues above are critical already.


On seeing a swap entry PTE, userfaultfd_move does a lockless swap cache
lookup, and tries to move the found folio to the faulting vma.  Currently,
it relies on checking the PTE value to ensure that the moved folio still
belongs to the src swap entry and that no new folio has been added to the
swap cache, which turns out to be unreliable.

While working and reviewing the swap table series with Barry, following
existing races are observed and reproduced [1]:

In the example below, move_pages_pte is moving src_pte to dst_pte, where
src_pte is a swap entry PTE holding swap entry S1, and S1 is not in the
swap cache:

CPU1                               CPU2
userfaultfd_move
  move_pages_pte()
    entry = pte_to_swp_entry(orig_src_pte);
    // Here it got entry = S1
    ... < interrupted> ...
                                   <swapin src_pte, alloc and use folio A>
                                   // folio A is a new allocated folio
                                   // and get installed into src_pte
                                   <frees swap entry S1>
                                   // src_pte now points to folio A, S1
                                   // has swap count == 0, it can be freed
                                   // by folio_swap_swap or swap
                                   // allocator's reclaim.
                                   <try to swap out another folio B>
                                   // folio B is a folio in another VMA.
                                   <put folio B to swap cache using S1 >
                                   // S1 is freed, folio B can use it
                                   // for swap out with no problem.
                                   ...
    folio = filemap_get_folio(S1)
    // Got folio B here !!!
    ... < interrupted again> ...
                                   <swapin folio B and free S1>
                                   // Now S1 is free to be used again.
                                   <swapout src_pte & folio A using S1>
                                   // Now src_pte is a swap entry PTE
                                   // holding S1 again.
    folio_trylock(folio)
    move_swap_pte
      double_pt_lock
      is_pte_pages_stable
      // Check passed because src_pte == S1
      folio_move_anon_rmap(...)
      // Moved invalid folio B here !!!

The race window is very short and requires multiple collisions of multiple
rare events, so it's very unlikely to happen, but with a deliberately
constructed reproducer and increased time window, it can be reproduced
easily.

This can be fixed by checking if the folio returned by filemap is the
valid swap cache folio after acquiring the folio lock.

Another similar race is possible: filemap_get_folio may return NULL, but
folio (A) could be swapped in and then swapped out again using the same
swap entry after the lookup.  In such a case, folio (A) may remain in the
swap cache, so it must be moved too:

CPU1                               CPU2
userfaultfd_move
  move_pages_pte()
    entry = pte_to_swp_entry(orig_src_pte);
    // Here it got entry = S1, and S1 is not in swap cache
    folio = filemap_get

      <title>CVE-2025-38243 - "Linux Btrfs Null Pointer Dereference Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38243
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix invalid inode pointer dereferences during log replay

In a few places where we call read_one_inode(), if we get a NULL pointer
we end up jumping into an error path, or fallthrough in case of
__add_inode_ref(), where we then do something like this:

   iput(&inode->vfs_inode);

which results in an invalid inode pointer that triggers an invalid memory
access, resulting in a crash.

Fix this by making sure we don't do such dereferences.

      <title>CVE-2025-38245 - "Google Compute Engine atm Device Registration Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38245
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

atm: Release atm_dev_mutex after removing procfs in atm_dev_deregister().

syzbot reported a warning below during atm_dev_register(). [0]

Before creating a new device and procfs/sysfs for it, atm_dev_register()
looks up a duplicated device by __atm_dev_lookup().  These operations are
done under atm_dev_mutex.

However, when removing a device in atm_dev_deregister(), it releases the
mutex just after removing the device from the list that __atm_dev_lookup()
iterates over.

So, there will be a small race window where the device does not exist on
the device list but procfs/sysfs are still not removed, triggering the
splat.

Let's hold the mutex until procfs/sysfs are removed in
atm_dev_deregister().

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-6742
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 9 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The SureForms – Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.3 via the use of file_exists() in the delete_entry_files() function without restriction on the path provided. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34077
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the WordPress Pie Register plugin ≤ 3.7.1.4 that allows unauthenticated attackers to impersonate arbitrary users by submitting a crafted POST request to the login endpoint. By setting social_site=true and manipulating the user_id_social_site parameter, an attacker can generate a valid WordPress session cookie for any user ID, including administrators. Once authenticated, the attacker may exploit plugin upload functionality to install a malicious plugin containing arbitrary PHP code, resulting in remote code execution on the underlying server.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unrestricted file upload vulnerability exists in the WordPress AIT CSV Import/Export plugin ≤ 3.0.3. The plugin exposes an upload handler at upload-handler.php that allows arbitrary file upload via a multipart/form-data POST request. This endpoint does not enforce authentication or content-type validation, enabling attackers to upload malicious PHP code directly to the server. Although the upload may produce an error related to CSV parsing, the malicious file is still saved under wp-content/uploads/ and remains executable. Notably, the plugin does not need to be active for exploitation to succeed.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34084
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unauthenticated information disclosure vulnerability exists in the WordPress Total Upkeep plugin (also known as BoldGrid Backup) prior to version 1.14.10. The plugin exposes multiple endpoints that allow unauthenticated users to retrieve detailed server configuration (env-info.php) and discover backup metadata (restore-info.json). These backups, which may include full SQL database dumps, are accessible without authentication if their paths are known or guessed. The restore-info.json endpoint discloses the absolute filesystem path of the latest backup, which attackers can convert into a web-accessible URL under wp-content/uploads/ and download. Extracting the database archive may yield credential hashes from the wp_users table, facilitating offline password cracking or credential stuffing attacks.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34085
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 9, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the WordPress Simple File List plugin prior to version 4.2.3 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to achieve remote code execution. The plugin's upload endpoint (ee-upload-engine.php) restricts file uploads based on extension, but lacks proper validation after file renaming. An attacker can first upload a PHP payload disguised as a .png file, then use the plugin’s ee-file-engine.php rename functionality to change the extension to .php. This bypasses upload restrictions and results in the uploaded payload being executable on the server.

      <title>CVE-2025-53547 - Helm Chart File Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53547
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 14 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Prior to 3.18.4, a specially crafted Chart.yaml file along with a specially linked Chart.lock file can lead to local code execution when dependencies are updated. Fields in a Chart.yaml file, that are carried over to a Chart.lock file when dependencies are updated and this file is written, can be crafted in a way that can cause execution if that same content were in a file that is executed (e.g., a bash.rc file or shell script). If the Chart.lock file is symlinked to one of these files updating dependencies will write the lock file content to the symlinked file. This can lead to unwanted execution. Helm warns of the symlinked file but did not stop execution due to symlinking. This issue has been resolved in Helm v3.18.4.

      <title>CVE-2025-48384 - Git Symlink Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48384
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-48385 - Git Bundle Protocol Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48385
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When cloning a repository Git knows to optionally fetch a bundle advertised by the remote server, which allows the server-side to offload parts of the clone to a CDN. The Git client does not perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles, which allows the remote side to perform protocol injection. This protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched bundle to a location controlled by the adversary. The fetched content is fully controlled by the server, which can in the worst case lead to arbitrary code execution. The use of bundle URIs is not enabled by default and can be controlled by the bundle.heuristic config option. Some cases of the vulnerability require that the adversary is in control of where a repository will be cloned to. This either requires social engineering or a recursive clone with submodules. These cases can thus be avoided by disabling recursive clones. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-48386 - Git Wincred Buffer Overflow Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48386
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. The wincred credential helper uses a static buffer (target) as a unique key for storing and comparing against internal storage. This credential helper does not properly bounds check the available space remaining in the buffer before appending to it with wcsncat(), leading to potential buffer overflows. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53372
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>node-code-sandbox-mcp is a Node.js–based Model Context Protocol server that spins up disposable Docker containers to execute arbitrary JavaScript. Prior to 1.3.0, a command injection vulnerability exists in the node-code-sandbox-mcp MCP Server. The vulnerability is caused by the unsanitized use of input parameters within a call to child_process.execSync, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the server process's privileges on the host machine, bypassing the sandbox protection of running code inside docker. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.3.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-38236 - Linux Unix af_unix Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38236
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 8, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 3 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Don't leave consecutive consumed OOB skbs.

Jann Horn reported a use-after-free in unix_stream_read_generic().

The following sequences reproduce the issue:

  $ python3
  from socket import *
  s1, s2 = socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM)
  s1.send(b'x', MSG_OOB)
  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb
  s1.send(b'y', MSG_OOB)
  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # leave a consumed OOB skb
  s1.send(b'z', MSG_OOB)
  s2.recv(1)              # recv 'z' illegally
  s2.recv(1, MSG_OOB)     # access 'z' skb (use-after-free)

Even though a user reads OOB data, the skb holding the data stays on
the recv queue to mark the OOB boundary and break the next recv().

After the last send() in the scenario above, the sk2's recv queue has
2 leading consumed OOB skbs and 1 real OOB skb.

Then, the following happens during the next recv() without MSG_OOB

  1. unix_stream_read_generic() peeks the first consumed OOB skb
  2. manage_oob() returns the next consumed OOB skb
  3. unix_stream_read_generic() fetches the next not-yet-consumed OOB skb
  4. unix_stream_read_generic() reads and frees the OOB skb

, and the last recv(MSG_OOB) triggers KASAN splat.

The 3. above occurs because of the SO_PEEK_OFF code, which does not
expect unix_skb_len(skb) to be 0, but this is true for such consumed
OOB skbs.

  while (skip >= unix_skb_len(skb)) {
    skip -= unix_skb_len(skb);
    skb = skb_peek_next(skb, &sk->sk_receive_queue);
    ...
  }

In addition to this use-after-free, there is another issue that
ioctl(SIOCATMARK) does not function properly with consecutive consumed
OOB skbs.

So, nothing good comes out of such a situation.

Instead of complicating manage_oob(), ioctl() handling, and the next
ECONNRESET fix by introducing a loop for consecutive consumed OOB skbs,
let's not leave such consecutive OOB unnecessarily.

Now, while receiving an OOB skb in unix_stream_recv_urg(), if its
previous skb is a consumed OOB skb, it is freed.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32023
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 38 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. From 2.8 to before 8.0.3, 7.4.5, 7.2.10, and 6.2.19, an authenticated user may use a specially crafted string to trigger a stack/heap out of bounds write on hyperloglog operations, potentially leading to remote code execution. The bug likely affects all Redis versions with hyperloglog operations implemented. This vulnerability is fixed in 8.0.3, 7.4.5, 7.2.10, and 6.2.19. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing hyperloglog operations. This can be done using ACL to restrict HLL commands.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in the `ObsidianReader` class of the run-llama/llama_index repository, versions 0.12.23 to 0.12.28, allows for arbitrary file read through symbolic links. The `ObsidianReader` fails to resolve symlinks to their real paths and does not validate whether the resolved paths lie within the intended directory. This flaw enables attackers to place symlinks pointing to files outside the vault directory, which are then processed as valid Markdown files, potentially exposing sensitive information.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3262
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 7, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was discovered in the huggingface/transformers repository, specifically in version 4.49.0. The vulnerability is due to inefficient regular expression complexity in the `SETTING_RE` variable within the `transformers/commands/chat.py` file. The regex contains repetition groups and non-optimized quantifiers, leading to exponential backtracking when processing 'almost matching' payloads. This can degrade application performance and potentially result in a denial-of-service (DoS) when handling specially crafted input strings. The issue is fixed in version 4.51.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-3108 - "LLama Index JsonPickleSerializer Python Pickle Deserialization RCE"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3108
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 6, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A critical deserialization vulnerability exists in the run-llama/llama_index library's JsonPickleSerializer component, affecting versions v0.12.27 through v0.12.40. This vulnerability allows remote code execution due to an insecure fallback to Python's pickle module. JsonPickleSerializer prioritizes deserialization using pickle.loads(), which can execute arbitrary code when processing untrusted data. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious payloads to achieve full system compromise. The root cause includes an insecure fallback mechanism, lack of validation or safeguards, misleading design, and violation of Python security guidelines.

      <title>CVE-2025-38235 - "Linux HID Backlight Reference Leak"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38235
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 6, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 13 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: appletb-kbd: fix "appletb_backlight" backlight device reference counting

During appletb_kbd_probe, probe attempts to get the backlight device
by name. When this happens backlight_device_get_by_name looks for a
device in the backlight class which has name "appletb_backlight" and
upon finding a match it increments the reference count for the device
and returns it to the caller. However this reference is never released
leading to a reference leak.

Fix this by decrementing the backlight device reference count on removal
via put_device and on probe failure.

      <title>CVE-2025-48952 - NetAlertX SHA-256 Magic Hash Login Bypass Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48952
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 22 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>NetAlertX is a network, presence scanner, and alert framework. Prior to version 25.6.7, a vulnerability in the authentication logic allows users to bypass password verification using SHA-256 magic hashes, due to loose comparison in PHP. In vulnerable versions of the application, a password comparison is performed using the `==` operator at line 40 in front/index.php. This introduces a security issue where specially crafted "magic hash" values that evaluate to true in a loose comparison can bypass authentication. Because of the use of `==` instead of the strict `===`, different strings that begin with 0e and are followed by only digits can be interpreted as scientific notation (i.e., zero) and treated as equal. This issue falls under the Login Bypass vulnerability class. Users with certain "weird" passwords that produce magic hashes are particularly affected. Services relying on this logic are at risk of unauthorized access. Version 25.6.7 fixes the vulnerability.
<br>

      <title>CVE-2025-53365 - Apache MCP Python SDK Denial of Service</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53365
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 23 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The MCP Python SDK, called `mcp` on PyPI, is a Python implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Prior to version 1.10.0, if a client deliberately triggers an exception after establishing a streamable HTTP session, this can lead to an uncaught ClosedResourceError on the server side, causing the server to crash and requiring a restart to restore service. Impact may vary depending on the deployment conditions, and presence of infrastructure-level resilience measures. Version 1.10.0 contains a patch for the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-49601 - MbedTLS LMS Public Key Buffer Out-of-Bounds Read</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-49601
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 16 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In MbedTLS 3.3.0 before 3.6.4, mbedtls_lms_import_public_key does not check that the input buffer is at least 4 bytes before reading a 32-bit field, allowing a possible out-of-bounds read on truncated input. Specifically, an out-of-bounds read in mbedtls_lms_import_public_key allows context-dependent attackers to trigger a crash or limited adjacent-memory disclosure by supplying a truncated LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature) public-key buffer under four bytes. An LMS public key starts with a 4-byte type indicator. The function mbedtls_lms_import_public_key reads this type indicator before validating the size of its input.

      <title>CVE-2025-49600 - MbedTLS LMS Signature Forgery Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-49600
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 12 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In MbedTLS 3.3.0 before 3.6.4, mbedtls_lms_verify may accept invalid signatures if hash computation fails and internal errors go unchecked, enabling LMS (Leighton-Micali Signature) forgery in a fault scenario. Specifically, unchecked return values in mbedtls_lms_verify allow an attacker (who can induce a hardware hash accelerator fault) to bypass LMS signature verification by reusing stale stack data, resulting in acceptance of an invalid signature. In mbedtls_lms_verify, the return values of the internal Merkle tree functions create_merkle_leaf_value and create_merkle_internal_value are not checked. These functions return an integer that indicates whether the call succeeded or not. If a failure occurs, the output buffer (Tc_candidate_root_node) may remain uninitialized, and the result of the signature verification is unpredictable. When the software implementation of SHA-256 is used, these functions will not fail. However, with hardware-accelerated hashing, an attacker could use fault injection against the accelerator to bypass verification.

      <title>CVE-2025-38234 - Linux Kernel Sched/rt: Push Rt Task Race Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38234
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/rt: Fix race in push_rt_task

Overview
========
When a CPU chooses to call push_rt_task and picks a task to push to
another CPU's runqueue then it will call find_lock_lowest_rq method
which would take a double lock on both CPUs' runqueues. If one of the
locks aren't readily available, it may lead to dropping the current
runqueue lock and reacquiring both the locks at once. During this window
it is possible that the task is already migrated and is running on some
other CPU. These cases are already handled. However, if the task is
migrated and has already been executed and another CPU is now trying to
wake it up (ttwu) such that it is queued again on the runqeue
(on_rq is 1) and also if the task was run by the same CPU, then the
current checks will pass even though the task was migrated out and is no
longer in the pushable tasks list.

Crashes
=======
This bug resulted in quite a few flavors of crashes triggering kernel
panics with various crash signatures such as assert failures, page
faults, null pointer dereferences, and queue corruption errors all
coming from scheduler itself.

      <title>CVE-2025-46733 - OP-TEE Secure Storage API Panic Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46733
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>OP-TEE is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) designed as companion to a non-secure Linux kernel running on Arm; Cortex-A cores using the TrustZone technology. In version 4.5.0, using a specially crafted tee-supplicant binary running in REE userspace, an attacker can trigger a panic in a TA that uses the libutee Secure Storage API. Many functions in libutee, specifically those which make up the Secure Storage API, will panic if a system call returns an unexpected return code. This behavior is mandated by the TEE Internal Core API specification. However, in OP-TEE’s implementation, return codes of secure storage operations are passed through unsanitized from the REE tee-supplicant, through the Linux kernel tee-driver, through the OP-TEE kernel, back to libutee. Thus, an attacker with access to REE userspace, and the ability to stop tee-supplicant and replace it with their own process (generally trivial for a root user, and depending on the way permissions are set up, potentially available even to less privileged users) can run a malicious tee-supplicant process that responds to storage requests with unexpected response codes, triggering a panic in the requesting TA. This is particularly dangerous for TAs built with `TA_FLAG_SINGLE_INSTANCE` (corresponding to `gpd.ta.singleInstance` and `TA_FLAG_INSTANCE_KEEP_ALIVE` (corresponding to `gpd.ta.keepAlive`). The behavior of these TAs may depend on memory that is preserved between sessions, and the ability of an attacker to panic the TA and reload it with a clean memory space can compromise the behavior of those TAs. A critical example of this is the optee_ftpm TA. It uses the kept alive memory to hold PCR values, which crucially must be non-resettable. An attacker who can trigger a panic in the fTPM TA can reset the PCRs, and then extend them PCRs with whatever they choose, falsifying boot measurements, accessing sealed data, and potentially more. The impact of this issue depends significantly on the behavior of affected TAs. For some, it could manifest as a denial of service, while for others, like the fTPM TA, it can result in the disclosure of sensitive data. Anyone running the fTPM TA is affected, but similar attacks may be possible on other TAs that leverage the Secure Storage API. A fix is available in commit 941a58d78c99c4754fbd4ec3079ec9e1d596af8f.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38229
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: cxusb: no longer judge rbuf when the write fails

syzbot reported a uninit-value in cxusb_i2c_xfer. [1]

Only when the write operation of usb_bulk_msg() in dvb_usb_generic_rw()
succeeds and rlen is greater than 0, the read operation of usb_bulk_msg()
will be executed to read rlen bytes of data from the dvb device into the
rbuf.

In this case, although rlen is 1, the write operation failed which resulted
in the dvb read operation not being executed, and ultimately variable i was
not initialized.

      <title>CVE-2025-38230 - Linux JFS Shift Out of Bounds Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38230
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: validate AG parameters in dbMount() to prevent crashes

Validate db_agheight, db_agwidth, and db_agstart in dbMount to catch
corrupted metadata early and avoid undefined behavior in dbAllocAG.
Limits are derived from L2LPERCTL, LPERCTL/MAXAG, and CTLTREESIZE:

- agheight: 0 to L2LPERCTL/2 (0 to 5) ensures shift
  (L2LPERCTL - 2*agheight) >= 0.
- agwidth: 1 to min(LPERCTL/MAXAG, 2^(L2LPERCTL - 2*agheight))
  ensures agperlev >= 1.
  - Ranges: 1-8 (agheight 0-3), 1-4 (agheight 4), 1 (agheight 5).
  - LPERCTL/MAXAG = 1024/128 = 8 limits leaves per AG;
    2^(10 - 2*agheight) prevents division to 0.
- agstart: 0 to CTLTREESIZE-1 - agwidth*(MAXAG-1) keeps ti within
  stree (size 1365).
  - Ranges: 0-1237 (agwidth 1), 0-348 (agwidth 8).

      <title>CVE-2025-38231 - Linux Kernel NFSd NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38231
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: Initialize ssc before laundromat_work to prevent NULL dereference

In nfs4_state_start_net(), laundromat_work may access nfsd_ssc through
nfs4_laundromat -> nfsd4_ssc_expire_umount. If nfsd_ssc isn't initialized,
this can cause NULL pointer dereference.

Normally the delayed start of laundromat_work allows sufficient time for
nfsd_ssc initialization to complete. However, when the kernel waits too
long for userspace responses (e.g. in nfs4_state_start_net ->
nfsd4_end_grace -> nfsd4_record_grace_done -> nfsd4_cld_grace_done ->
cld_pipe_upcall -> __cld_pipe_upcall -> wait_for_completion path), the
delayed work may start before nfsd_ssc initialization finishes.

Fix this by moving nfsd_ssc initialization before starting laundromat_work.

It reproduced simply with below script:

do
insmod /nfsd.ko
mount -t nfsd none /proc/fs/nfsd
umount /proc/fs/nfsd
rmmod nfsd

So exporting interfaces to user space shall be done at last and
cleanup at first place.

With change there is no Kernel OOPs.

      <title>CVE-2025-38224 - Kvaser PCIEFD Linux Kernel Slab Out-of-Bounds Write</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38224
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 7 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: kvaser_pciefd: refine error prone echo_skb_max handling logic

echo_skb_max should define the supported upper limit of echo_skb[]
allocated inside the netdevice's priv. The corresponding size value
provided by this driver to alloc_candev() is KVASER_PCIEFD_CAN_TX_MAX_COUNT
which is 17.

But later echo_skb_max is rounded up to the nearest power of two (for the
max case, that would be 32) and the tx/ack indices calculated further
during tx/rx may exceed the upper array boundary. Kasan reported this for
the ack case inside kvaser_pciefd_handle_ack_packet(), though the xmit
function has actually caught the same thing earlier.

 BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in kvaser_pciefd_handle_ack_packet+0x2d7/0x92a drivers/net/can/kvaser_pciefd.c:1528

Tx max count definitely matters for kvaser_pciefd_tx_avail(), but for seq
numbers' generation that's not the case - we're free to calculate them as
would be more convenient, not taking tx max count into account. The only
downside is that the size of echo_skb[] should correspond to the max seq
number (not tx max count), so in some situations a bit more memory would
be consumed than could be.

Thus make the size of the underlying echo_skb[] sufficient for the rounded
max tx value.

      <title>CVE-2025-38225 - Vulnerability Title: "Imx-Jpeg Linux Kernel NULL Pointer Dereference"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38225
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 7 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: imx-jpeg: Cleanup after an allocation error

When allocation failures are not cleaned up by the driver, further
allocation errors will be false-positives, which will cause buffers to
remain uninitialized and cause NULL pointer dereferences.
Ensure proper cleanup of failed allocations to prevent these issues.

      <title>CVE-2025-38222 - Linux ext4 Inline Data Overflow</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38222
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: inline: fix len overflow in ext4_prepare_inline_data

When running the following code on an ext4 filesystem with inline_data
feature enabled, it will lead to the bug below.

        fd = open("file1", O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0666);
        ftruncate(fd, 30);
        pwrite(fd, "a", 1, (1UL << 40) + 5UL);

That happens because write_begin will succeed as when
ext4_generic_write_inline_data calls ext4_prepare_inline_data, pos + len
will be truncated, leading to ext4_prepare_inline_data parameter to be 6
instead of 0x10000000006.

Then, later when write_end is called, we hit:

        BUG_ON(pos + len > EXT4_I(inode)->i_inline_size);

at ext4_write_inline_data.

Fix it by using a loff_t type for the len parameter in

      <title>CVE-2025-38217 - Linux Kernel hwmon ftsteutates Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38217
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 45 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (ftsteutates) Fix TOCTOU race in fts_read()

In the fts_read() function, when handling hwmon_pwm_auto_channels_temp,
the code accesses the shared variable data->fan_source[channel] twice
without holding any locks. It is first checked against
FTS_FAN_SOURCE_INVALID, and if the check passes, it is read again
when used as an argument to the BIT() macro.

This creates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition.
Another thread executing fts_update_device() can modify the value of
data->fan_source[channel] between the check and its use. If the value
is changed to FTS_FAN_SOURCE_INVALID (0xff) during this window, the
BIT() macro will be called with a large shift value (BIT(255)).
A bit shift by a value greater than or equal to the type width is
undefined behavior and can lead to a crash or incorrect values being
returned to userspace.

Fix this by reading data->fan_source[channel] into a local variable
once, eliminating the race condition. Additionally, add a bounds check
to ensure the value is less than BITS_PER_LONG before passing it to
the BIT() macro, making the code more robust against undefined behavior.

This possible bug was found by an experimental static analysis tool
developed by our team.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38218

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to do sanity check on sit_bitmap_size

w/ below testcase, resize will generate a corrupted image which
contains inconsistent metadata, so when mounting such image, it
will trigger kernel panic:

touch img
truncate -s $((512*1024*1024*1024)) img
mkfs.f2fs -f img $((256*1024*1024))
resize.f2fs -s -i img -t $((1024*1024*1024))
mount img /mnt/f2fs

The reaseon is:

sit_i->bitmap_size is 192, so size of sit bitmap is 192*8=1536, at maximum
there are 1536 sit blocks, however MAIN_SEGS is 261893, so that sit_blk_cnt
is 4762, build_sit_entries() -> current_sit_addr() tries to access
out-of-boundary in sit_bitmap at offset from [1536, 4762), once sit_bitmap
and sit_bitmap_mirror is not the same, it will trigger f2fs_bug_on().

Let's add sanity check in f2fs_sanity_check_ckpt() to avoid panic.

      <title>CVE-2025-38220 - Linux Kernel ext4 NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38220
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 45 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: only dirty folios when data journaling regular files

fstest generic/388 occasionally reproduces a crash that looks as
follows:

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
...
Call Trace:
 <TASK>

 ...

This occurs when processing a symlink inode from the orphan list. The
partial block zeroing code in the truncate path calls
ext4_dirty_journalled_data() -> folio_mark_dirty(). The latter calls
mapping->a_ops->dirty_folio(), but symlink inodes are not assigned an
a_ops vector in ext4, hence the crash.

To avoid this problem, update the ext4_dirty_journalled_data() helper to
only mark the folio dirty on regular files (for which a_ops is
assigned). This also matches the journaling logic in the ext4_symlink()
creation path, where ext4_handle_dirty_metadata() is called directly.

      <title>CVE-2025-38215 - Linux Kernel fbdev Null-Pointer Dereference Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38215
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: Fix do_register_framebuffer to prevent null-ptr-deref in fb_videomode_to_var

If fb_add_videomode() in do_register_framebuffer() fails to allocate
memory for fb_videomode, it will later lead to a null-ptr dereference in
fb_videomode_to_var(), as the fb_info is registered while not having the
mode in modelist that is expected to be there, i.e. the one that is
described in fb_info->var.

Even though fbcon_init() checks beforehand if fb_match_mode() in
var_to_display() fails, it can not prevent the panic because fbcon_init()
does not return error code. Considering this and the comment in the code
about fb_match_mode() returning NULL - "This should not happen" - it is
better to prevent registering the fb_info if its mode was not set
successfully. Also move fb_add_videomode() closer to the beginning of
do_register_framebuffer() to avoid having to do the cleanup on fail.

      <title>CVE-2025-38216 - "Apple IOMMU VT-d Device Aliasing Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38216
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Restore context entry setup order for aliased devices

Commit 2031c469f816 ("iommu/vt-d: Add support for static identity domain")
changed the context entry setup during domain attachment from a
set-and-check policy to a clear-and-reset approach. This inadvertently
introduced a regression affecting PCI aliased devices behind PCIe-to-PCI
bridges.

Specifically, keyboard and touchpad stopped working on several Apple
Macbooks with below messages:

 kernel: platform pxa2xx-spi.3: Adding to iommu group 20
 kernel: input: Apple SPI Keyboard as
 /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.3/pxa2xx-spi.3/spi_master/spi2/spi-APP000D:00/input/input0

Fix this by restoring the previous context setup order.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38177
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sch_hfsc: make hfsc_qlen_notify() idempotent

hfsc_qlen_notify() is not idempotent either and not friendly
to its callers, like fq_codel_dequeue(). Let's make it idempotent
to ease qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() callers' life:

1. update_vf() decreases cl->cl_nactive, so we can check whether it is
non-zero before calling it.

2. eltree_remove() always removes RB node cl->el_node, but we can use
   RB_EMPTY_NODE() + RB_CLEAR_NODE() to make it safe.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Contact Form 7 Database Addon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘tmpD’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

      <title>CVE-2025-7066 - Jirafeau MIME Type Bypass Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-7066
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Jirafeau normally prevents browser preview for text files due to the possibility that for example SVG and HTML documents could be exploited for cross site scripting. This was done by storing the MIME type of a file and allowing only browser preview for MIME types beginning with image (except for image/svg+xml, see CVE-2022-30110 and CVE-2024-12326), video and audio. However, it was possible to bypass this check by sending a manipulated MIME type containing a comma and an other MIME type like text/html (for example image/png,text/html). Browsers see multiple MIME types and text/html would takes precedence, allowing a possible attacker to do a cross-site scripting attack. The check for MIME types was enhanced to prevent a browser preview when the stored MIME type contains a comma.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38174
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 42 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thunderbolt: Do not double dequeue a configuration request

Some of our devices crash in tb_cfg_request_dequeue():

 general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdead000000000122

 CPU: 6 PID: 91007 Comm: kworker/6:2 Tainted: G U W 6.6.65
 RIP: 0010:tb_cfg_request_dequeue+0x2d/0xa0
 Call Trace:

 kthread+0xed/0x110
 ret_from_fork+0x38/0x50
 ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30

The circumstances are unclear, however, the theory is that
tb_cfg_request_work() can be scheduled twice for a request:
first time via frame.callback from ring_work() and second
time from tb_cfg_request().  Both times kworkers will execute
tb_cfg_request_dequeue(), which results in double list_del()
from the ctl->request_queue (the list poison deference hints
at it: 0xdead000000000122).

Do not dequeue requests that don't have TB_CFG_REQUEST_ACTIVE
bit set.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-5372
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 4, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A flaw was found in libssh versions built with OpenSSL versions older than 3.0, specifically in the ssh_kdf() function responsible for key derivation. Due to inconsistent interpretation of return values where OpenSSL uses 0 to indicate failure and libssh uses 0 for success—the function may mistakenly return a success status even when key derivation fails. This results in uninitialized cryptographic key buffers being used in subsequent communication, potentially compromising SSH sessions' confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 56 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. In Next.js App Router from 15.3.0 to before 15.3.3 and Vercel CLI from 41.4.1 to 42.2.0, a cache poisoning vulnerability was found. The issue allowed page requests for HTML content to return a React Server Component (RSC) payload instead under certain conditions. When deployed to Vercel, this would only impact the browser cache, and would not lead to the CDN being poisoned. When self-hosted and deployed externally, this could lead to cache poisoning if the CDN does not properly distinguish between RSC / HTML in the cache keys. This issue has been resolved in Next.js 15.3.3.

      <title>CVE-2025-34061 - PHPStudy Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution Backdoor</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34061
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A backdoor in PHPStudy versions 2016 through 2018 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code on affected installations. The backdoor listens for base64-encoded PHP payloads in the Accept-Charset HTTP header of incoming requests, decodes and executes the payload without proper validation. This leads to remote code execution as the web server user, compromising the affected system.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34082
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A command injection vulnerability exists in IGEL OS versions prior to 11.04.270 within the Secure Terminal and Secure Shadow services. The flaw arises due to improper input sanitization in the handling of specially crafted PROXYCMD commands on TCP ports 30022 and 5900. An unauthenticated attacker with network access to a vulnerable device can inject arbitrary commands, leading to remote code execution with elevated privileges.

NOTE: IGEL OS v10.x has reached end-of-life (EOL) status.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34086
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Bolt CMS versions 3.7.0 and earlier contain a chain of vulnerabilities that together allow an authenticated user to achieve remote code execution. A user with valid credentials can inject arbitrary PHP code into the displayname field of the user profile, which is rendered unsanitized in backend templates. The attacker can then list and rename cached session files via the /async/browse/cache/.sessions and /async/folder/rename endpoints. By renaming a .session file to a path under the publicly accessible /files/ directory with a .php extension, the attacker can turn the injected code into an executable web shell. Finally, the attacker triggers the payload via a crafted HTTP GET request to the rogue file.

NOTE: The vendor announced that Bolt 3 reached end-of-life after 31 December 2021.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34087
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated command injection vulnerability exists in Pi-hole versions up to 3.3. When adding a domain to the allowlist via the web interface, the domain parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to append OS commands to the domain string. These commands are executed on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the Pi-hole service user.




This behavior was present in the legacy AdminLTE interface and has since been patched in later versions.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in Pandora FMS version 7.0NG and earlier. The net_tools.php functionality allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary OS commands via the select_ips parameter when performing network tools operations, such as pinging. This occurs because user input is not properly sanitized before being passed to system commands, enabling command injection.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34089
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 55 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in Remote for Mac, a macOS remote control utility developed by Aexol Studio, in versions up to and including 2025.7. When the application is configured with authentication disabled (i.e., the "Allow unknown devices" option is enabled), the /api/executeScript endpoint is exposed without access control. This allows unauthenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary AppleScript payloads via the X-Script HTTP header, resulting in code execution using do shell script. Successful exploitation grants attackers the ability to run arbitrary commands on the macOS host with the privileges of the Remote for Mac background process.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-49846
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>wire-ios is an iOS client for the Wire secure messaging application. From Wire iOS 3.111.1 to before 3.124.1, messages that were visible in the view port have been logged to the iOS system logs in clear text. Wire application logs created and managed by the application itself were not affected, especially not the logs users can export and send to Wire support. The iOS logs can only be accessed if someone had (physical) access to the underlying unlocked device. The issue manifested itself by calling canOpenUrl() and passing an invalid URL object. When iOS then performs the check and fails, it logs the contents to the system log. This is not documented behaviour. Wire released an emergency fix with version 3.124.1. As a workaround, users can reset their iOS device to remove the offending logs. Since Wire cannot access or modify iOS system logs, there's no other workaround other than a reset.

      <title>CVE-2025-48939 - Tarteaucitron.js Script Element Property Clobbering Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-48939
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>tarteaucitron.js is a compliant and accessible cookie banner. Prior to version 1.22.0, a vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js where document.currentScript was accessed without verifying that it referenced an actual <script> element. If an attacker injected an HTML element, it could clobber the document.currentScript property. This causes the script to resolve incorrectly to an element instead of the <script> tag, leading to unexpected behavior or failure to load the script path correctly. This issue arises because in some browser environments, named DOM elements become properties on the global document object. An attacker with control over the HTML could exploit this to change the CDN domain of tarteaucitron. This issue has been patched in version 1.22.0.

Dans cette dynamique, les deux agences enrichissent leurs réflexions et harmonisent leurs prises de position au niveau européen sur les règlementations européennes.</p>
<p>Dans ce cadre, elles co-publient aujourd’hui un document conjoint sur la vérification d'identité à distance « Remote Identity Proofing for EUDI Wallet Onboarding : Strengthening Assurance Against Evolving Threats. », suite de la première publication sur le même sujet, mis en ligne en décembre 2023.</p>
<p>En effet, pour mieux répondre aux besoins du marché numérique et renforcer la souveraineté numérique européenne, le cadre réglementaire eIDAS 2 pour l’identification électronique et les services de confiance a été modernisé et adopté en février 2024. Le principal changement structurel apporté par eIDAS 2 repose sur l’introduction d’un European Digital Identity Wallet, portefeuille numérique européen, dont l’obtention peut s’appuyer sur une vérification d’identité à distance.</p>
<p>En cohérence avec ces nouvelles orientations réglementaires, cette seconde édition de ce document conjoint permet de mieux saisir l’engagement de l’ANSSI et du BSI à contribuer activement à l’appropriation du portefeuille numérique européen et à anticiper l’évolution de la menace relative à la vérification d’identité à distance.</p>
<p>La publication met en lumière les progrès réalisés, les défis à relever face aux potentielles attaques et la nécessité d’une approche globale paneuropéenne des tests, de la certification et de la normalisation afin de garantir sécurité, résilience et confiance.</p>

      <title>CVE-2025-43713 - ASNA Assist and ASNA Registrar Deserialization Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-43713
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ASNA Assist and ASNA Registrar before 2025-03-31 allow deserialization attacks against .NET remoting. These are Windows system services that support license key management and deprecated Windows network authentication. The services are implemented with .NET remoting and can be exploited via well-known deserialization techniques inherent in the technology. Because the services run with SYSTEM-level rights, exploits can be crafted to achieve escalation of privilege and arbitrary code execution. This affects DataGate for SQL Server 17.0.36.0 and 16.0.89.0, DataGate Component Suite 17.0.36.0 and 16.0.89.0, DataGate Monitor 17.0.26.0 and 16.0.65.0, DataGate WebPak 17.0.37.0 and 16.0.90.0, Monarch for .NET 11.4.50.0 and 10.0.62.0, Encore RPG 4.1.36.0, Visual RPG .NET FW 17.0.37.0 and 16.0.90.0, Visual RPG .NET FW Windows Deployment 17.0.36.0 and 16.0.89.0, WingsRPG 11.0.38.0 and 10.0.95.0, Mobile RPG 11.0.35.0 and 10.0.94.0, Monarch Framework for .NET FW 11.0.36.0 and 10.0.89.0, Browser Terminal 17.0.37.0 and 16.0.90.0, Visual RPG Classic 5.2.7.0 and 5.1.17.0, Visual RPG Deployment 5.2.7.0 and 5.1.17.0, and DataGate Studio 17.0.38.0 and 16.0.104.0.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-49595
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>n8n is a workflow automation platform. Prior to version 1.99.0, there is a denial of Service vulnerability in /rest/binary-data endpoint when processing empty filesystem URIs (filesystem:// or filesystem-v2://). This allows authenticated attackers to cause service unavailability through malformed filesystem URI requests, effecting the /rest/binary-data endpoint and n8n.cloud instances (confirmed HTTP/2 524 timeout responses). Attackers can exploit this by sending GET requests with empty filesystem URIs (filesystem:// or filesystem-v2://) to the /rest/binary-data endpoint, causing resource exhaustion and service disruption. This issue has been patched in version 1.99.0.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-27458
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 54 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The VNC authentication mechanism bases on a challenge-response system where both server and client use the same password for encryption. The challenge is sent from the server to the client, is encrypted by the client and sent back. The server does the same encryption locally and if the responses match it is prooven that the client knows the correct password. Since all VNC communication is unencrypted, an attacker can obtain the challenge and response and try to derive the password from this information.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/cma: Fix hang when cma_netevent_callback fails to queue_work

The cited commit fixed a crash when cma_netevent_callback was called for
a cma_id while work on that id from a previous call had not yet started.
The work item was re-initialized in the second call, which corrupted the
work item currently in the work queue.

However, it left a problem when queue_work fails (because the item is
still pending in the work queue from a previous call). In this case,
cma_id_put (which is called in the work handler) is therefore not
called. This results in a userspace process hang (zombie process).

Fix this by calling cma_id_put() if queue_work fails.

      <title>CVE-2025-38153 - Allegro USB Network AQC111 Uninitialized Memory Access Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38153

<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: aqc111: fix error handling of usbnet read calls

Syzkaller, courtesy of syzbot, identified an error (see report [1]) in
aqc111 driver, caused by incomplete sanitation of usb read calls'
results. This problem is quite similar to the one fixed in commit
920a9fa27e78 ("net: asix: add proper error handling of usb read errors").

For instance, usbnet_read_cmd() may read fewer than 'size' bytes,
even if the caller expected the full amount, and aqc111_read_cmd()
will not check its result properly. As [1] shows, this may lead
to MAC address in aqc111_bind() being only partly initialized,
triggering KMSAN warnings.

Fix the issue by verifying that the number of bytes read is
as expected and not less.

      <title>CVE-2025-38154 - Linux Kernel BPF Sockmap Use After Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38154
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, sockmap: Avoid using sk_socket after free when sending

The sk->sk_socket is not locked or referenced in backlog thread, and
during the call to skb_send_sock(), there is a race condition with
the release of sk_socket. All types of sockets(tcp/udp/unix/vsock)
will be affected.

Race conditions:
'''
CPU0                               CPU1

backlog::skb_send_sock
  sendmsg_unlocked
    sock_sendmsg
      sock_sendmsg_nosec
                                   close(fd):
                                     ...
                                     ops->release() -> sock_map_close()
                                     sk_socket->ops = NULL
                                     free(socket)
      sock->ops->sendmsg
            ^
            panic here
'''

The ref of psock become 0 after sock_map_close() executed.
'''
void sock_map_close()
{
    ...
    if (likely(psock)) {
    ...
    // !! here we remove psock and the ref of psock become 0
    sock_map_remove_links(sk, psock)
    psock = sk_psock_get(sk);
    if (unlikely(!psock))
        goto no_psock; <=== Control jumps here via goto
        ...
        cancel_delayed_work_sync(&psock->work); <=== not executed
        sk_psock_put(sk, psock);
        ...
}
'''

Based on the fact that we already wait for the workqueue to finish in
sock_map_close() if psock is held, we simply increase the psock
reference count to avoid race conditions.

With this patch, if the backlog thread is running, sock_map_close() will
wait for the backlog thread to complete and cancel all pending work.

If no backlog running, any pending work that hasn't started by then will
fail when invoked by sk_psock_get(), as the psock reference count have
been zeroed, and sk_psock_drop() will cancel all jobs via
cancel_delayed_work_sync().

In summary, we require synchronization to coordinate the backlog thread
and close() thread.

The panic I catched:
'''

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath9k_htc: Abort software beacon handling if disabled

A malicious USB device can send a WMI_SWBA_EVENTID event from an
ath9k_htc-managed device before beaconing has been enabled. This causes
a device-by-zero error in the driver, leading to either a crash or an
out of bounds read.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38158
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hisi_acc_vfio_pci: fix XQE dma address error

The dma addresses of EQE and AEQE are wrong after migration and
results in guest kernel-mode encryption services  failure.
Comparing the definition of hardware registers, we found that
there was an error when the data read from the register was
combined into an address. Therefore, the address combination
sequence needs to be corrected.

Even after fixing the above problem, we still have an issue
where the Guest from an old kernel can get migrated to
new kernel and may result in wrong data.

In order to ensure that the address is correct after migration,
if an old magic number is detected, the dma address needs to be
updated.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: prevent overflow in lookup table allocation

When calculating the lookup table size, ensure the following
multiplication does not overflow:

- desc->field_len[] maximum value is U8_MAX multiplied by
  NFT_PIPAPO_GROUPS_PER_BYTE(f) that can be 2, worst case.
- NFT_PIPAPO_BUCKETS(f->bb) is 2^8, worst case.
- sizeof(unsigned long), from sizeof(*f->lt), lt in
  struct nft_pipapo_field.

Then, use check_mul_overflow() to multiply by bucket size and then use
check_add_overflow() to the alignment for avx2 (if needed). Finally, add
lt_size_check_overflow() helper and use it to consolidate this.

While at it, replace leftover allocation using the GFP_KERNEL to
GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT for consistency, in pipapo_resize().

The panic originates from the assertion BUG_ON(skb_shared(skb)) in
skb_linearize(). A previous commit(see Fixes tag) introduced skb_get()
to avoid race conditions between skb operations in the backlog and skb
release in the recvmsg path. However, this caused the panic to always
occur when skb_linearize is executed.

The "--rx-strp 100000" parameter forces the RX path to use the strparser
module which aggregates data until it reaches 100KB before calling sockmap
logic. The 100KB payload exceeds MAX_MSG_FRAGS, triggering skb_linearize.

To fix this issue, just move skb_get into sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue.

After calling bpf_exec_tx_verdict(), the size of msg_pl->sg may increase,
e.g., when the BPF program executes bpf_msg_push_data().

If the BPF program sets cork_bytes and sg.size is smaller than cork_bytes,
it will return -ENOSPC and attempt to roll back to the non-zero copy
logic. However, during rollback, msg->msg_iter is reset, but since
msg_pl->sg.size has been increased, subsequent executions will exceed the
actual size of msg_iter.
'''
iov_iter_revert(&msg->msg_iter, msg_pl->sg.size - orig_size);
'''

The changes in this commit are based on the following considerations:

1. When cork_bytes is set, rolling back to non-zero copy logic is
pointless and can directly go to zero-copy logic.

2. We can not calculate the correct number of bytes to revert msg_iter.

Assume the original data is "abcdefgh" (8 bytes), and after 3 pushes
by the BPF program, it becomes 11-byte data: "abc?de?fgh?".
Then, we set cork_bytes to 6, which means the first 6 bytes have been
processed, and the remaining 5 bytes "?fgh?" will be cached until the
length meets the cork_bytes requirement.

However, some data in "?fgh?" is not within 'sg->msg_iter'
(but in msg_pl instead), especially the data "?" we pushed.

So it doesn't seem as simple as just reverting through an offset of
msg_iter.

3. For non-TLS sockets in tcp_bpf_sendmsg, when a "cork" situation occurs,
the user-space send() doesn't return an error, and the returned length is
the same as the input length parameter, even if some data is cached.

Additionally, I saw that the current non-zero-copy logic for handling
corking is written as:
'''
line 1177
else if (ret != -EAGAIN) {
	if (ret == -ENOSPC)
		ret = 0;
	goto send_end;
'''

So it's ok to just return 'copied' without error when a "cork" situation
occurs.

<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: handle hdr_first_de() return value

The hdr_first_de() function returns a pointer to a struct NTFS_DE. This
pointer may be NULL. To handle the NULL error effectively, it is important
to implement an error handler. This will help manage potential errors
consistently.

Additionally, error handling for the return value already exists at other
points where this function is called.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/fpsimd: Avoid clobbering kernel FPSIMD state with SMSTOP

On system with SME, a thread's kernel FPSIMD state may be erroneously
clobbered during a context switch immediately after that state is
restored. Systems without SME are unaffected.

If the CPU happens to be in streaming SVE mode before a context switch
to a thread with kernel FPSIMD state, fpsimd_thread_switch() will
restore the kernel FPSIMD state using fpsimd_load_kernel_state() while
the CPU is still in streaming SVE mode. When fpsimd_thread_switch()
subsequently calls fpsimd_flush_cpu_state(), this will execute an
SMSTOP, causing an exit from streaming SVE mode. The exit from
streaming SVE mode will cause the hardware to reset a number of
FPSIMD/SVE/SME registers, clobbering the FPSIMD state.

Fix this by calling fpsimd_flush_cpu_state() before restoring the kernel
FPSIMD state.

      <title>CVE-2025-38170 - Linux kernel - arm64 FPSIMD SME Trap Handling Stale CPU State Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38170
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/fpsimd: Discard stale CPU state when handling SME traps

The logic for handling SME traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state
incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having
TIF_SME set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state
is stale (e.g. with SME traps enabled). This can result in warnings from
do_sme_acc() where SME traps are not expected while TIF_SME is set:

|        /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */
|        if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))
|                WARN_ON(1);

This is very similar to the SVE issue we fixed in commit:

  751ecf6afd6568ad ("arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps")

The race can occur when the SME trap handler is preempted before and
after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, starting and ending on
the same CPU, e.g.

| void do_sme_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
| {
|         // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SME clear, SME traps enabled
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0.
|         // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task.
|
|         ...
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1.
|         // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.
|
|         get_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         /* With TIF_SME userspace shouldn't generate any traps */
|         if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SME))
|                 WARN_ON(1);
|
|         if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
|                 unsigned long vq_minus_one =
|                         sve_vq_from_vl(task_get_sme_vl(current)) - 1;
|                 sme_set_vq(vq_minus_one);
|
|                 fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu();
|         }
|
|         put_cpu_fpsimd_context();
|
|         // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0.
|         // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0
|         // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then:
|         // - Stale HW state is reused (with SME traps enabled)
|         // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared
|         // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore
| }

Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set
by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU
state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the
stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the
new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.

      <title>CVE-2025-38172 - "Linux EROFS UAF Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38172
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: avoid using multiple devices with different type

For multiple devices, both primary and extra devices should be the
same type. `erofs_init_device` has already guaranteed that if the
primary is a file-backed device, extra devices should also be
regular files.

However, if the primary is a block device while the extra device
is a file-backed device, `erofs_init_device` will get an ENOTBLK,
which is not treated as an error in `erofs_fc_get_tree`, and that
leads to an UAF:

  erofs_fc_get_tree
    get_tree_bdev_flags(erofs_fc_fill_super)
      erofs_read_superblock
        erofs_init_device  // sbi->dif0 is not inited yet,
                           // return -ENOTBLK
      deactivate_locked_super
        free(sbi)
    if (err is -ENOTBLK)
      sbi->dif0.file = filp_open()  // sbi UAF

So if -ENOTBLK is hitted in `erofs_init_device`, it means the
primary device must be a block device, and the extra device
is not a block device. The error can be converted to -EINVAL.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: mscc: Fix memory leak when using one step timestamping

Fix memory leak when running one-step timestamping. When running
one-step sync timestamping, the HW is configured to insert the TX time
into the frame, so there is no reason to keep the skb anymore. As in
this case the HW will never generate an interrupt to say that the frame
was timestamped, then the frame will never released.
Fix this by freeing the frame in case of one-step timestamping.

      <title>CVE-2025-38149 - Linux Kernel Net Phydev Devlink Crash Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38149
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 53 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: clear phydev->devlink when the link is deleted

There is a potential crash issue when disabling and re-enabling the
network port. When disabling the network port, phy_detach() calls
device_link_del() to remove the device link, but it does not clear
phydev->devlink, so phydev->devlink is not a NULL pointer. Then the
network port is re-enabled, but if phy_attach_direct() fails before
calling device_link_add(), the code jumps to the "error" label and
calls phy_detach(). Since phydev->devlink retains the old value from
the previous attach/detach cycle, device_link_del() uses the old value,
which accesses a NULL pointer and causes a crash. The simplified crash
log is as follows.

[   24.702421] Call trace:
[   24.704856]  device_link_put_kref+0x20/0x120
[   24.709124]  device_link_del+0x30/0x48
[   24.712864]  phy_detach+0x24/0x168

[   24.725140]  phylink_of_phy_connect+0x1c/0x34

Therefore, phydev->devlink needs to be cleared when the device link is
deleted.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38150
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 3, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 53 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_packet: move notifier's packet_dev_mc out of rcu critical section

Syzkaller reports the following issue:

Calling `PACKET_ADD_MEMBERSHIP` on an ops-locked device can trigger
the `NETDEV_UNREGISTER` notifier, which may require disabling promiscuous
and/or allmulti mode. Both of these operations require acquiring
the netdev instance lock.

Move the call to `packet_dev_mc` outside of the RCU critical section.
The `mclist` modifications (add, del, flush, unregister) are protected by
the RTNL, not the RCU. The RCU only protects the `sklist` and its
associated `sks`. The delayed operation on the `mclist` entry remains
within the RTNL.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in Lucee’s administrative interface due to insecure design in the scheduled task functionality. An administrator with access to /lucee/admin/web.cfm can configure a scheduled job to retrieve a remote .cfm file from an attacker-controlled server, which is written to the Lucee webroot and executed with the privileges of the Lucee service account. Because Lucee does not enforce integrity checks, path restrictions, or execution controls for scheduled task fetches, this feature can be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution. This issue is distinct from CVE-2024-55354.

      <title>CVE-2025-34075 - Vagrant Virtual Machine Escape via Ruby Code Injection</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34075
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated virtual machine escape vulnerability exists in HashiCorp Vagrant when using the default synced folder configuration. By design, Vagrant automatically mounts the host system’s project directory into the guest VM under /vagrant (or C:\vagrant on Windows). This includes the Vagrantfile configuration file, which is a Ruby script evaluated by the host every time a vagrant command is executed in the project directory. If a low-privileged attacker obtains shell access to the guest VM, they can append arbitrary Ruby code to the mounted Vagrantfile. When a user on the host later runs any vagrant command, the injected code is executed on the host with that user’s privileges.

 While this shared-folder behavior is well-documented by Vagrant, the security implications of Vagrantfile execution from guest-writable storage are not explicitly addressed. This effectively enables guest-to-host code execution in multi-tenant or adversarial VM scenarios.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34076
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated local file inclusion vulnerability exists in Microweber CMS versions <= 1.2.11 through misuse of the backup management API. Authenticated users can abuse the /api/BackupV2/upload and /api/BackupV2/download endpoints to read arbitrary files from the underlying filesystem. By specifying an absolute file path in the src parameter of the upload request, the server may relocate or delete the target file depending on the web service user’s privileges. The corresponding download endpoint can then be used to retrieve the file contents, effectively enabling local file disclosure. This behavior stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied paths and inadequate restrictions on file access and backup logic.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34078
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in NSClient++ 0.5.2.35 when both the web interface and ExternalScripts features are enabled. The configuration file (nsclient.ini) stores the administrative password in plaintext and is readable by local users. By extracting this password, an attacker can authenticate to the NSClient++ web interface (typically accessible on port 8443) and abuse the ExternalScripts plugin to inject and execute arbitrary commands as SYSTEM by registering a custom script, saving the configuration, and triggering it via the API.

This behavior is documented but insecure, as the plaintext credential exposure undermines access isolation between local users and administrative functions.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34079
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in NSClient++ version 0.5.2.35 when the web interface and ExternalScripts module are enabled. A remote attacker with the administrator password can authenticate to the web interface (default port 8443), inject arbitrary commands as external scripts via the /settings/query.json API, save the configuration, and trigger the script via the /query/{name} endpoint. The injected commands are executed with SYSTEM privileges, enabling full remote compromise.

This capability is an intended feature, but the lack of safeguards or privilege separation makes it risky when exposed to untrusted actors.

      <title>CVE-2025-34090 - "Google Chrome AppBound Cookie Encryption Bypass"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34090
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A security bypass vulnerability exists in Google Chrome AppBound cookie encryption mechanism due to insufficient validation of COM server paths during inter-process communication. A local low-privileged attacker can hijack the COM class identifier (CLSID) registration used by Chrome's elevation service and point it to a non-existent or malicious binary. When this hijack occurs, Chrome silently falls back to the legacy cookie encryption mechanism (protected only by user-DPAPI), thereby enabling cookie decryption by any user-context malware without SYSTEM-level access. This flaw bypasses the protections intended by the AppBound encryption design and allows cookie theft from Chromium-based browsers.

Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.

      <title>CVE-2025-34091 - Google Chrome AppBound Encryption Padding Oracle</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34091
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A padding oracle vulnerability exists in Google Chrome’s AppBound cookie encryption mechanism due to observable decryption failure behavior in Windows Event Logs when handling malformed ciphertext in SYSTEM-DPAPI-encrypted blobs. A local attacker can repeatedly send malformed ciphertexts to the Chrome elevation service and distinguish between padding and MAC errors, enabling a padding oracle attack. This allows partial decryption of the SYSTEM-DPAPI layer and eventual recovery of the user-DPAPI encrypted cookie key, which is trivially decrypted by the attacker’s own context. This issue undermines the core purpose of AppBound Encryption by enabling low-privileged cookie theft through cryptographic misuse and verbose error feedback.

Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.

This behavior arises from a combination of Chrome’s AppBound implementation and the way Microsoft Windows DPAPI reports decryption failures via Event Logs. As such, the vulnerability relies on cryptographic behavior and error visibility in all supported versions of Windows.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34092
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A cookie encryption bypass vulnerability exists in Google Chrome’s AppBound mechanism due to weak path validation logic within the elevation service. When Chrome encrypts a cookie key, it records its own executable path as validation metadata. Later, when decrypting, the elevation service compares the requesting process’s path to this stored path. However, due to path canonicalization inconsistencies, an attacker can impersonate Chrome (e.g., by naming their binary chrome.exe and placing it in a similar path) and successfully retrieve the encrypted cookie key. This allows malicious processes to retrieve cookies intended to be restricted to the Chrome process only.

Confirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 15 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ethereum is a common ethereum structs for Rust. Prior to ethereum crate v0.18.0, signature malleability (according to EIP-2) was only checked for "legacy" transactions, but not for EIP-2930, EIP-1559 and EIP-7702 transactions. This is a specification deviation. The signature malleability itself is not a security issue and not as high of a risk if the ethereum crate is used on a single-implementation blockchain. This issue has been patched in version v0.18.0. A workaround for this issue involves manually checking transaction malleability outside of the crate, however upgrading is recommended.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38093
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 51 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100: Add GPU cooling

Unlike the CPU, the GPU does not throttle its speed automatically when it
reaches high temperatures. With certain high GPU loads it is possible to
reach the critical hardware shutdown temperature of 120°C, endangering the
hardware and making it impossible to run certain applications.

Set up GPU cooling similar to the ACPI tables, by throttling the GPU speed
when reaching 95°C and polling every 200ms.

      <title>CVE-2025-53106 - Graylog API Token Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53106
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 53 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Graylog is a free and open log management platform. In versions 6.2.0 to before 6.2.4 and 6.3.0-alpha.1 to before 6.3.0-rc.2, Graylog users can gain elevated privileges by creating and using API tokens for the local Administrator or any other user for whom the malicious user knows the ID. For the attack to succeed, the attacker needs a user account in Graylog. They can then proceed to issue hand-crafted requests to the Graylog REST API and exploit a weak permission check for token creation. This issue has been patched in versions 6.2.4 and 6.3.0-rc.2. A workaround involves disabling the respective configuration found in System > Configuration > Users > "Allow users to create personal access tokens".

      <title>CVE-2025-34072 - "Anthropic Slack MCP Server Data Exfiltration Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34072
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A data exfiltration vulnerability exists in Anthropic’s deprecated Slack Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server via automatic link unfurling. When an AI agent using the Slack MCP Server processes untrusted data, it can be manipulated to generate messages containing attacker-crafted hyperlinks embedding sensitive data. Slack’s link preview bots (e.g., Slack-LinkExpanding, Slackbot, Slack-ImgProxy) will then issue outbound requests to the attacker-controlled URL, resulting in zero-click exfiltration of private data.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34073
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An unauthenticated command injection vulnerability exists in stamparm/maltrail (Maltrail) versions <=0.54.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34069
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in GFI Kerio Control 9.4.5 due to insecure default proxy configuration and weak access control in the GFIAgent service. The non-transparent proxy on TCP port 3128 can be used to forward unauthenticated requests to internal services such as GFIAgent, bypassing firewall restrictions and exposing internal management endpoints. This enables unauthenticated attackers to access the GFIAgent service on ports 7995 and 7996, retrieve the appliance UUID, and issue administrative requests via the proxy. Exploitation results in full administrative access to the Kerio Control appliance.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-34070
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A missing authentication vulnerability in the GFIAgent component of GFI Kerio Control 9.4.5 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform privileged operations. The GFIAgent service, responsible for integration with GFI AppManager, exposes HTTP services on ports 7995 and 7996 without proper authentication. The /proxy handler on port 7996 allows arbitrary forwarding to administrative endpoints when provided with an Appliance UUID, which itself can be retrieved from port 7995. This results in a complete authentication bypass, permitting access to sensitive administrative APIs.

      <title>CVE-2025-24332 - Nokia Single RAN AirScale Baseband SSH Privilege Escalation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-24332
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 6 hours, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Nokia Single RAN AirScale baseband allows an authenticated administrative user access to all physical boards after performing a single login to the baseband system board. The baseband does not re-authenticate the user when they connect from the baseband system board to the baseband capacity boards using the internal bsoc SSH service, which is available only internally within the baseband and through the internal backplane between the boards. The bsoc SSH allows login from one board to another via the baseband internal backplane using an SSH private key present on the baseband system board.

This bsoc SSH capability was previously considered an administrative functionality but has now been restricted to be available only to baseband root-privileged administrators. This restriction mitigates the possibility of misuse with lower-level privileges (e.g., from baseband software images). This mitigation is included starting from release 23R4-SR 3.0 MP and later

      <title>CVE-2025-24333 - Nokia Single RAN Baseband Administrative Shell Command Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-24333
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 6 hours, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Nokia Single RAN baseband software earlier than 24R1-SR 1.0 MP contains administrative shell input validation fault, which authenticated admin user can, in theory, potentially use for injecting arbitrary commands for unprivileged baseband OAM service process execution via special characters added to baseband internal COMA_config.xml file.

This issue has been corrected starting from release 24R1-SR 1.0 MP and later, by adding proper input validation to OAM service process which prevents injecting special characters via baseband internal COMA_config.xml file.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-24331
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 2, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 50 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Single RAN baseband OAM service is intended to run as an unprivileged service. However, it initially starts with root privileges and assigns certain capabilities before dropping to an unprivileged level. The capabilities retained from the root period are considered extensive after the privilege drop and, in theory, could potentially allow actions beyond the intended scope of the OAM service. These actions could include gaining root privileges, accessing root-owned files, modifying them as the file owner, and then returning them to root ownership. This issue has been corrected starting from release 24R1-SR 0.2 MP and later.

Beginning with release 24R1-SR 0.2 MP, the OAM service software capabilities are restricted to the minimum necessary.

      <title>CVE-2024-46993 - Electron Heap Buffer Overflow</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-46993
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 1, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 10 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Electron is an open source framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In versions prior to 28.3.2, 29.3.3, and 30.0.3, the nativeImage.createFromPath() and nativeImage.createFromBuffer() functions call a function downstream that is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. An Electron program that uses either of the affected functions is vulnerable to a buffer overflow if an attacker is in control of the image's height, width, and contents. This issue has been patched in versions  28.3.2, 29.3.3, and 30.0.3. There are no workarounds for this issue.

      <title>CVE-2024-49364 - Tiny-SECP256k1 Buffer Package Private Key Extraction Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-49364
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 1, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 10 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>tiny-secp256k1 is a tiny secp256k1 native/JS wrapper. Prior to version 1.1.7, a private key can be extracted on signing a malicious JSON-stringifiable object, when global Buffer is the buffer package. This affects only environments where require('buffer') is the NPM buffer package. The Buffer.isBuffer check can be bypassed, resulting in k reuse for different messages, leading to private key extraction over a single invalid message (and a second one for which any message/signature could be taken, e.g. previously known valid one). This issue has been patched in version 1.1.7.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 1, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 10 hours, 47 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>tiny-secp256k1 is a tiny secp256k1 native/JS wrapper. Prior to version 1.1.7, a malicious JSON-stringifyable message can be made passing on verify(), when global Buffer is the buffer package. This affects only environments where require('buffer') is the NPM buffer package. Buffer.isBuffer check can be bypassed, resulting in strange objects being accepted as a message, and those messages could trick verify() into returning false-positive true values. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.7.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-46992
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 1, 2025, 2:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 47 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Electron is an open source framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. From versions 30.0.0-alpha.1 to before 30.0.5 and 31.0.0-alpha.1 to before 31.0.0-beta.1, Electron is vulnerable to an ASAR Integrity bypass. This only impacts apps that have the embeddedAsarIntegrityValidation and onlyLoadAppFromAsar fuses enabled. Apps without these fuses enabled are not impacted. This issue is specific to Windows, apps using these fuses on macOS are not impacted. Specifically this issue can only be exploited if the app is launched from a filesystem the attacker has write access too. i.e. the ability to edit files inside the .app bundle on macOS which these fuses are supposed to protect against. This issue has been patched in versions 30.0.5 and 31.0.0-beta.1. There are no workarounds for this issue.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53095
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> July 1, 2025, 2:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 47 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Sunshine is a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight. Prior to version 2025.628.4510, the web UI of Sunshine lacks protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious web page that, when visited by an authenticated user, can trigger unintended actions within the Sunshine application on behalf of that user. Specifically, since the application does OS command execution by design, this issue can be exploited to abuse the "Command Preparations" feature, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed with Administrator privileges when an application is launched. This issue has been patched in version 2025.628.4510.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-52901
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 25 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. Prior to version 2.33.9, access tokens are used as GET parameters. The JSON Web Token (JWT) which is used as a session identifier will get leaked to anyone having access to the URLs accessed by the user. This will give an attacker full access to a user's account and, in consequence, to all sensitive files the user has access to. This issue has been patched in version 2.33.9.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 25 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files. Prior to version 2.33.10, the implementation of the allowlist is erroneous, allowing a user to execute more shell commands than they are authorized for. The concrete impact of this vulnerability depends on the commands configured, and the binaries installed on the server or in the container image. Due to the missing separation of scopes on the OS-level, this could give an attacker access to all files managed the application, including the File Browser database. This issue has been patched in version 2.33.10.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>File Browser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit files.

      <title>CVE-2025-40710 - Hotspot Shield VPN Host Header Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-40710
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Host Header Injection (HHI) vulnerability in the Hotspot Shield VPN client, which can induce unexpected behaviour when accessing third-party web applications through the VPN tunnel. Although such applications do not present this vulnerability per se, the use of the tunnel, together with a forged Host header, can cause the VPN client to redirect or forward HTTP requests to servers other than those originally intended, leading to consequences such as open redirects or delivery of traffic to infrastructure controlled by an attacker. This does not imply a flaw in the target applications, but in how the VPN client internally handles outgoing headers and requests.

      <title>CVE-2025-38090 - Linux Kernel Rapidio Heap Overwrite Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38090
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 6 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers/rapidio/rio_cm.c: prevent possible heap overwrite

In

riocm_cdev_ioctl(RIO_CM_CHAN_SEND)
   -> cm_chan_msg_send()
      -> riocm_ch_send()

cm_chan_msg_send() checks that userspace didn't send too much data but
riocm_ch_send() failed to check that userspace sent sufficient data.  The
result is that riocm_ch_send() can write to fields in the rio_ch_chan_hdr
which were outside the bounds of the space which cm_chan_msg_send()
allocated.

Address this by teaching riocm_ch_send() to check that the entire
rio_ch_chan_hdr was copied in from userspace.

      <title>CVE-2025-38089 - SunRPC Authentication Error Handling Remote Crash Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38089
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sunrpc: handle SVC_GARBAGE during svc auth processing as auth error

tianshuo han reported a remotely-triggerable crash if the client sends a
kernel RPC server a specially crafted packet. If decoding the RPC reply
fails in such a way that SVC_GARBAGE is returned without setting the
rq_accept_statp pointer, then that pointer can be dereferenced and a
value stored there.

If it's the first time the thread has processed an RPC, then that
pointer will be set to NULL and the kernel will crash. In other cases,
it could create a memory scribble.

The server sunrpc code treats a SVC_GARBAGE return from svc_authenticate
or pg_authenticate as if it should send a GARBAGE_ARGS reply. RFC 5531
says that if authentication fails that the RPC should be rejected
instead with a status of AUTH_ERR.

Handle a SVC_GARBAGE return as an AUTH_ERROR, with a reason of
AUTH_BADCRED instead of returning GARBAGE_ARGS in that case. This
sidesteps the whole problem of touching the rpc_accept_statp pointer in
this situation and avoids the crash.

      <title>CVE-2025-38087 - Linux Kernel Taprio Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38087
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 30, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: fix use-after-free in taprio_dev_notifier

Since taprio’s taprio_dev_notifier() isn’t protected by an
RCU read-side critical section, a race with advance_sched()
can lead to a use-after-free.

Adding rcu_read_lock() inside taprio_dev_notifier() prevents this.

      <title>CVE-2025-38086 - "NetChip Ch9200 Uninitialized Memory Access Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38086
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 28, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 12 hours, 24 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ch9200: fix uninitialised access during mii_nway_restart

In mii_nway_restart() the code attempts to call
mii->mdio_read which is ch9200_mdio_read(). ch9200_mdio_read()
utilises a local buffer called "buff", which is initialised
with control_read(). However "buff" is conditionally
initialised inside control_read():

        if (err == size) {
                memcpy(data, buf, size);
        }

If the condition of "err == size" is not met, then
"buff" remains uninitialised. Once this happens the
uninitialised "buff" is accessed and returned during
ch9200_mdio_read():

        return (buff[0] | buff[1] << 8);

The problem stems from the fact that ch9200_mdio_read()
ignores the return value of control_read(), leading to
uinit-access of "buff".

To fix this we should check the return value of
control_read() and return early on error.

      <title>CVE-2025-5937 - WordPress MicroPayments Fans Paysite CSRF Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-5937
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 28, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 12 hours, 24 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The MicroPayments – Fans Paysite: Paid Creator Subscriptions, Digital Assets, Wallet plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the adminOptions() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

      <title>CVE-2025-38084 - Linux Kernel Hugetlb Racy Protection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38084
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 28, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 11 hours, 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb: unshare page tables during VMA split, not before

Currently, __split_vma() triggers hugetlb page table unsharing through
vm_ops->may_split().  This happens before the VMA lock and rmap locks are
taken - which is too early, it allows racing VMA-locked page faults in our
process and racing rmap walks from other processes to cause page tables to
be shared again before we actually perform the split.

Fix it by explicitly calling into the hugetlb unshare logic from
__split_vma() in the same place where THP splitting also happens.  At that
point, both the VMA and the rmap(s) are write-locked.

An annoying detail is that we can now call into the helper
hugetlb_unshare_pmds() from two different locking contexts:

1. from hugetlb_split(), holding:
    - mmap lock (exclusively)
    - VMA lock
    - file rmap lock (exclusively)
2. hugetlb_unshare_all_pmds(), which I think is designed to be able to
   call us with only the mmap lock held (in shared mode), but currently
   only runs while holding mmap lock (exclusively) and VMA lock

Backporting note:
This commit fixes a racy protection that was introduced in commit
b30c14cd6102 ("hugetlb: unshare some PMDs when splitting VMAs"); that
commit claimed to fix an issue introduced in 5.13, but it should actually
also go all the way back.

      <title>CVE-2025-38085 - Linux Kernel: Huge Page Table Unshare Race Condition Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-38085
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 28, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 11 hours, 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb: fix huge_pmd_unshare() vs GUP-fast race

huge_pmd_unshare() drops a reference on a page table that may have
previously been shared across processes, potentially turning it into a
normal page table used in another process in which unrelated VMAs can
afterwards be installed.

If this happens in the middle of a concurrent gup_fast(), gup_fast() could
end up walking the page tables of another process.  While I don't see any
way in which that immediately leads to kernel memory corruption, it is
really weird and unexpected.

Fix it with an explicit broadcast IPI through tlb_remove_table_sync_one(),
just like we do in khugepaged when removing page tables for a THP
collapse.

      <title>CVE-2025-53097 - Roo Code Schema Fetching File Read and Write Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53097
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 27, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 36 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent. Prior to version 3.20.3, there was an issue where the Roo Code agent's `search_files` tool did not respect the setting to disable reads outside of the VS Code workspace. This means that an attacker who was able to inject a prompt into the agent could potentially read a sensitive file and then write the information to a JSON schema. Users have the option to disable schema fetching in VS Code, but the feature is enabled by default. For users with this feature enabled, writing to the schema would trigger a network request without the user having a chance to deny. This issue is of moderate severity, since it requires the attacker to already be able to submit prompts to the agent. Version 3.20.3 fixed the issue where `search_files` did not respect the setting to limit it to the workspace. This reduces the scope of the damage if an attacker is able to take control of the agent through prompt injection or another vector.

      <title>CVE-2025-53098 - Roo Code MCP Configuration Command Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53098
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 27, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 36 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Roo Code is an AI-powered autonomous coding agent. The project-specific MCP configuration for the Roo Code agent is stored in the `.roo/mcp.json` file within the VS Code workspace. Because the MCP configuration format allows for execution of arbitrary commands, prior to version 3.20.3, it would have been possible for an attacker with access to craft a prompt to ask the agent to write a malicious command to the MCP configuration file. If the user had opted-in to auto-approving file writes within the project, this would have led to arbitrary command execution. This issue is of moderate severity, since it requires the attacker to already be able to submit prompts to the agent (for instance through a prompt injection attack), for the user to have MCP enabled (on by default), and for the user to have enabled auto-approved file writes (off by default). Version 3.20.3 fixes the issue by adding an additional layer of opt-in configuration for auto-approving writing to Roo's configuration files, including all files within the `.roo/` folder.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-52553
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 27, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 52 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>authentik is an open-source identity provider. After authorizing access to a RAC endpoint, authentik creates a token which is used for a single connection and is sent to the client in the URL. This token is intended to only be valid for the session of the user who authorized the connection, however this check is missing in versions prior to 2025.6.3 and 2025.4.3. When, for example, using RAC during a screenshare, a malicious user could access the same session by copying the URL from the shown browser. authentik 2025.4.3 and 2025.6.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, it is recommended to decrease the duration a token is valid for (in the RAC Provider settings, set Connection expiry to `minutes=5` for example). The maintainers of authentik also recommend enabling the option Delete authorization on disconnect.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-53018
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> June 27, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 36 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Lychee is a free, open-source photo-management tool. Prior to version 6.6.13, a critical Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `/api/v2/Photo::fromUrl` endpoint. This flaw lets an attacker instruct the application’s backend to make HTTP requests to any URL they choose. Consequently, internal network resources—such as localhost services or cloud-provider metadata endpoints—become reachable. The endpoint takes a URL from the user and calls it server-side via fopen() without any safeguards. There is no IP address validation, nor are there any allow-list, timeout, or size restrictions. Because of this, attackers can point the application at internal targets. Using this flaw, an attacker can perform internal port scans or retrieve sensitive cloud metadata. Version 6.6.13 contains a patch for the issue.

            <div class="field field--name-field-chapo field--type-string-long field--label-hidden field__item">À l’occasion de la publication de la quatrième édition de l’Observatoire des métiers, le Centre de Formation à la Sécurité des Systèmes d’Information (CFSSI) de l’ANSSI, en partenariat avec l’AFPA et la DGEFP, fait le point sur les évolutions du marché de l’emploi dans le domaine de la cybersécurité, au cours des cinq dernières années.</div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-texte-riche field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Face à une menace cyber toujours plus présente, les différents acteurs du secteur public et privé se doivent de mettre en place des stratégies efficaces pour se protéger. À l’heure où le recrutement de spécialistes en matière de sécurité des systèmes d’information apparaît, de fait, essentiel, l’analyse du marché du travail réalisée dans cette 4<sup>e</sup> édition de l’Observatoire des métiers démontre que le nombre d’offres d’emploi disponibles a considérablement augmenté dans ce secteur.</p>
<p>Seulement, les employeurs continuent à rencontrer de grandes difficultés pour trouver des candidats, et ce, malgré le développement de nombreuses offres de formations pour répondre aux besoins du marché.</p>
<h3>Le rôle de l’Observatoire des métiers</h3>
<p>Afin de comprendre les raisons réelles de cette pénurie et d’identifier les leviers les plus pertinents qui pourraient permettre aux politiques publiques de lancer des initiatives capables de résoudre la situation, l’ANSSI, la Délégation générale à l’Emploi et à la Formation professionnelle (DGEFP) et l’Agence nationale pour la formation professionnelle des adultes (Afpa), recensent et collectent des indicateurs concernant les formations en cybersécurité ainsi que les offres d’emploi dans ce domaine, depuis 2021, via l’Observatoire des métiers.</p>
<h3>Les résultats de l’enquête 2025 réalisée auprès des professionnels de la cybersécurité</h3>
<p>En 2025, l’Observatoire des métiers a reconduit l’enquête menée en 2021 auprès des professionnels de la cybersécurité afin de réaliser une photographie générale de la population composant l’écosystème cyber français. L’objectif étant de mieux connaître certaines de leurs caractéristiques : parcours, profils, cadres d’exercices des missions et perspectives d’évolutions.</p>
<h4>Quelques chiffres clés</h4>
<ul><li>1 répondant sur 2 travaille dans une structure de 1 000 salariés ou plus et 66 % des répondants travaillent dans le secteur privé.</li>
<li>Une large majorité d’hommes, soit 85 % des répondants, composent l’écosystème cyber français.</li>
<li>Pour la moitié des répondants, la cybersécurité ne constitue pas leur domaine d’expertise d’origine. En effet, 40 % des répondants ont principalement exercé dans le domaine de l’informatique/ numérique et 12 % ont principalement exercé dans un autre domaine.</li>
</ul><h3>Les résultats de l’étude 2025 menée sur le marché du travail des professionnels de la cybersécurité</h3>
<p>Cette seconde enquête, réalisée à partir d’un un outil d’agrégation, a permis de quantifier et d’analyser plus de 23 000 offres d’emploi publiées entre juin 2023 et juin 2024, dans le domaine de la cybersécurité, en France. L’objectif ? Identifier les grandes tendances du marché, notamment les types d’offres, le niveau de qualifications attendu ou encore la localisation des offres.</p>
<h4>Quelques chiffres clés</h4>
<ul><li>Une augmentation de 49 % du nombres d’offres d’emploi s’est opérée entre 2019 et 2024.</li>
<li>Une large majorité des offres concernent des contrats à durée indéterminée.</li>
<li>Le niveau de qualification reste élevé avec 40 % des offres qui requièrent un niveau Bac+5.</li>

<p>L’étude propose en effet un nouvel outil mathématique appelé <em>« syzygy distinguisher »</em>. Déjà utilisé en cryptographie, les distinguisher ont toutefois montré des limites face à certains problèmes complexes de cryptographie. Celui proposé par Hugues dans son papier offre des résultats considérablement supérieurs lorsqu’il s’agit de reconnaître des codes cryptographiques utilisés pour sécuriser les communications, notamment dans le cadre de la cryptographie post-quantique.</p>
<p>L’attribution de ce prix constitue une reconnaissance forte des travaux menés par Hugues Randriam et par l’ensemble du laboratoire de cryptographie de l’ANSSI. Elle souligne également l’engagement constant des équipes de l’Agence dans la recherche scientifique.</p>
<p>C’est une grande fierté pour l’ANSSI, non seulement pour le rayonnement de ses laboratoires, mais aussi pour le travail mené au quotidien par l’ensemble de ses agents.</p>

<p>Les « parcours de cybersécurité » avaient pour objectif d’élever la sécurité numérique des services publics, de dynamiser l’industrie de cybersécurité française et européenne et de favoriser des investissements durables au service de la cybersécurité des organisations.</p>
<p>Pendant 4 ans, l’ANSSI a conçu, déployé et piloté un dispositif d’accompagnement au profit des collectivités, des établissements de santé et des entités publiques. Ainsi, 945 entités parmi les plus vulnérables à la menace cyber ont pu bénéficier de cet accompagnement, dont :</p>
<ul><li>707 collectivités territoriales,</li>
<li>134 établissements de santé,</li>
<li>87 autres établissements publics,</li>
<li>17 centres de recherche et d’enseignement supérieur,</li>
</ul><p>Parmi celles-ci, 62 entités ont été accompagnées dans les territoires d’Outre-mer.</p>
<p>Les parcours ont permis d’élever le niveau de cyberdéfense des bénéficiaires de manière significative : en moyenne, les bénéficiaires sont passés d’un score de maturité cyber de D+ à B, soulignant un progrès conséquent. Grâce aux parcours, les entités ont réussi à s’intégrer dans l’écosystème cyber de leur territoire et de leur secteur, en lien avec l’ANSSI, et sont ainsi solidement ancrées dans une démarche de sécurisation à long terme.</p>
<p>Au-delà des bénéfices pour les entités accompagnées, les parcours de cybersécurité laissent un héritage exploitable dans la durée, notamment dans la perspective de la mise en œuvre de la directive NIS 2 avec la mise à disposition d’outils et de méthodes adaptés aux besoins de chaque bénéficiaire.</p>
<p>Le programme a permis de dynamiser l’offre industrielle de cybersécurité dans les territoires et de renforcer l’offre française et européenne de cybersécurité :</p>
<ul><li>197 prestataires présents sur l’ensemble du territoire national ont été impliqués.</li>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-texte-riche field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Les transports urbains constituent un secteur critique et les attaques informatiques qui le visent peuvent avoir des conséquences significatives qui génèrent parfois des difficultés dans la continuité des services ou encore dans la sécurisation des données. La menace à l’encontre des entités du secteur cible des entreprises de toute taille, dans le monde entier, et qui ont la gestion d’une large variété de moyen de transports. Répondant à ses missions de connaissance de la menace informatique, l’ANSSI partage un état de la menace sur le secteur du transport urbain.</p>
<h3><strong>Un secteur fortement exposé en 2024</strong></h3>
<p>Tout au long de l’année, le contexte des Jeux Olympiques et Paralympiques de Paris 2024 a mis en lumière l’exposition de ce secteur aux cyberattaques, les tensions géopolitiques ayant été un catalyseur fort de cette menace avec de nombreuses attaques par déni de services.</p>
<p>L’imbrication de plusieurs réseaux informatiques de grande taille ainsi que la diversité des équipements qui les composent met en exergue des niveaux de sécurisation hétérogène complexifiant d’autant plus les questions de sécurité des systèmes d’information et augmentant significativement la surface d’attaque.</p>
<p>Les entités du secteur sont également fortement ciblées en raison du grand nombre de données personnelles des usagers, ainsi une attention toute particulière doit être portée à la protection de ces bases de données qui font régulièrement l’objet d’attaques à des fins d’exfiltration.</p>
<h3><strong>Prévenir et se protéger contre ces menaces</strong></h3>
<p>Dans son état de la menace, l’ANSSI rappelle l’importance d’avoir une approche globale de la sécurité et recommande aux entités de réaliser une cartographie globale des systèmes d’information afin d’identifier les risques affectant l’entité ou encore mesurer la maturité des systèmes d’informations concernés.</p>
<p>Il est essentiel de travailler sur des modes de fonctionnement dégradé notamment pour assurer et préparer en parallèle un <strong>plan de continuité d’activité (PCA)</strong> et un <strong>plan de reprise d’activité (PRA)</strong>. La mise en pratique ces recommandations permettra au secteur des transports urbains d’anticiper ces menaces.</p>

<h3><strong>Les Jeux olympiques et paralympiques de Paris 2024 comme consécration du modèle français de cyberdéfense</strong></h3>
<p>En tant que cheffe de file du volet cyber, l’ANSSI a été au cœur de la préparation des Jeux olympiques et paralympiques de Paris 2024. Le succès de cet événement international majeur est un accomplissement pour l’Agence, qui témoigne également de la pertinence du modèle de cyberdéfense français bâti autour d’une autorité nationale et ancré dans un écosystème élargi et déployé dans les territoires. Les Jeux sont le résultat d’une méthode – anticipation, préparation, entraînement – et d’une équipe – l’écosystème cyber public et privé – qui doivent perdurer pour<strong> permettre à la France de rester parmi les grandes nations de la cybersécurité.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>La directive NIS 2, vecteur d’une transformation profonde pour l’ANSSI</strong></h3>
<p>En 2024, l’ANSSI a poursuivi ses travaux de transposition de la directive NIS 2 qui sont le moteur d’un changement majeur de son organisation, de ses méthodes et de sa manière d’interagir avec ses bénéficiaires et ses partenaires. Déjà fortement mobilisées sur le sujet au cours des dernières années, les équipes de l’Agence continueront de l’être au quotidien, en coordination avec l’écosystème cyber, pour accompagner des milliers d’entités dans leur cybersécurité.</p>
<h3><strong>Des progrès précieux pour l’élévation générale de la cybersécurité de l’Union européenne</strong></h3>
<p>À l’image du cadre réglementaire défini par NIS 2, ou encore du vote du règlement sur la résilience cyber, pour lesquels l’ANSSI s’est pleinement engagée, la cybersécurité en Europe a connu de belles avancées en 2024. Par ailleurs, face aux évolutions technologiques, et notamment aux technologies de rupture, la conservation d’une maîtrise souveraine des expertises techniques s’impose comme une mission essentielle de l’ANSSI.</p>
<h4><strong>L’année 2024 en quelques chiffres :</strong></h4>
<ul><li><strong>656 </strong>agents âgés en moyenne de <strong>36 </strong>ans, œuvrent au quotidien pour la cybersécurité de la Nation, au sein de l’ANSSI.</li>

          Cette année exceptionnelle ouvre désormais la voie à une nouvelle étape pour l’ANSSI, qui a été partagée dans notre stratégie pour 2025-2027 . Il s’agit de prendre acte des évolutions non seulement du paysage cyber, mais également de notre environnement plus global. Pour ce faire, nous aurons besoin de « l’équipe de France » de cybersécurité à nos côtes.
