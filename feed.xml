      <title>Synthient Stealer Log Threat Data - 182,962,095 breached accounts</title>
      <description><![CDATA[During 2025, <a href="https//www.troyhunt.com/inside-the-synthient-threat-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Synthient aggregated billions of records of "threat data" from various internet sources</a>. The data contained 183M unique email addresses alongside the websites they were entered into and the passwords used. After normalising and deduplicating the data, 183 million unique email addresses remained, each linked to the website where the credentials were captured, and the password used. This dataset is now searchable in HIBP by email address, password, domain, and the site on which the credentials were entered.  ]]></description>

Comprised of email addresses and passwords from previous data breaches, these lists are used by attackers to compromise other, unrelated accounts of victims who have reused their passwords. The data also included 1.3 billion unique passwords, which are now searchable in Pwned Passwords. Working to turn breached data into awareness, Synthient partnered with HIBP to help victims of cybercrime understand their exposure.  ]]></description>
