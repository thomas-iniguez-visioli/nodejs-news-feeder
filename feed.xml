      <description>[[[[[[FastAPI Users allows users to quickly add a registration and authentication system to their FastAPI project. Prior to version 15.0.2, the OAuth login state tokens are completely stateless and carry no per-request entropy or any data that could link them to the session that initiated the OAuth flow. `generate_state_token()` is always called with an empty `state_data` dict, so the resulting JWT only contains the fixed audience claim plus an expiration timestamp. On callback, the library merely checks that the JWT verifies under `state_secret` and is unexpired there is no attempt to match the state value to the browser that initiated the OAuth request, no correlation cookie, and no server-side cache. Any attacker can hit `/authorize`, capture the server-generated state, finish the upstream OAuth flow with their own provider account, and then trick a victim into loading `.../callback?code=attacker_code>state=attacker_state>`. Because the state JWT is valid for any client for \~1 hour, the victim’s browser will complete the flow. This leads to login CSRF. Depending on the app’s logic, the login CSRF can lead to an account takeover of the victim account or to the victim user getting logged in to the attacker's account. Version 15.0.2 contains a patch for the issue. | CVSS Score 5.9 (MEDIUM)              </description>

      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[Langflow is a tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. Prior to version 1.7.0, Langflow provides an API Request component that can issue arbitrary HTTP requests within a flow. This component takes a user-supplied URL, performs only normalization and basic format checks, and then sends the request using a server-side httpx client. It does not block private IP ranges (127[.]0[.]0[.]1, the 10/172/192 ranges) or cloud metadata endpoints (169[.]254[.]169[.]254), and it returns the response body as the result. Because the flow execution endpoints (/api/v1/run, /api/v1/run/advanced) can be invoked with just an API key, if an attacker can control the API Request URL in a flow, non-blind SSRF is possible—accessing internal resources from the server’s network context. This enables requests to, and collection of responses from, internal administrative endpoints, metadata services, and internal databases/services, leading to information disclosure and providing a foothold for further attacks. Version 1.7.0 contains a patch for this issue. | CVSS Score 7.7 (HIGH)                                    </description>

Due to insufficient validation in the `recv_igmp()` function in src/igmpproxy.c, an invalid group record type can trigger a NULL pointer dereference when logging the address using `inet_fmtsrc()`. This vulnerability can be exploited by sending malformed multicast traffic to a host running igmpproxy, leading to a crash. igmpproxy is used in various embedded networking environments and consumer-grade IoT devices (such as home routers and media gateways) to handle multicast traffic for IPTV and other streaming services. Affected devices that rely on unpatched versions of igmpproxy may be vulnerable to remote denial-of-service attacks across a LAN . | Severity UNKNOWN                                            </description>

The OcrController in turms-ai-serving/src/main/java/im/turms/ai/domain/ocr/controller/OcrController.java uses the @FormData(contentType = MediaTypeConst.IMAGE) annotation to restrict uploads to image files, but this constraint is not properly enforced. The system relies solely on client-provided Content-Type headers and file extensions without validating actual file content using magic bytes (file signatures). An attacker can upload arbitrary file types including executables, scripts, HTML, or web shells by setting the Content-Type header to "image/*" or using an image file extension. This bypass enables potential server-side code execution, stored XSS, or information disclosure depending on how uploaded files are processed and served. | Severity UNKNOWN                                            </description>

The ExtendedOpenCVImage class in ai/djl/opencv/ExtendedOpenCVImage.java loads images using OpenCV's imread() function without validating dimensions or pixel count before decompression. An attacker can upload a specially crafted compressed image file (e.g., PNG) that is small when compressed but expands to gigabytes of memory when loaded. This causes immediate memory exhaustion, OutOfMemoryError, and service crash. No authentication is required if the OCR service is publicly accessible. Multiple requests can completely deny service availability. | Severity UNKNOWN                                            </description>

The GetAsanaObject Processor used generic Java Object serialization and deserialization without filtering. Unfiltered Java object deserialization does not provide protection against crafted state information stored in the cache server configured for GetAsanaObject. Exploitation requires an Apache NiFi system running with the GetAsanaObject Processor, and direct access to the configured cache server. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.7.0 is the recommended mitigation, which replaces Java Object serialization with JSON serialization.

      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[Versions of the package fastapi-sso before 0.19.0 are vulnerable to Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to the improper validation of the OAuth state parameter during the authentication callback. While the get_login_url method allows for state generation, it does not persist the state or bind it to the user's session. Consequently, the verify_and_process method accepts the state received in the query parameters without verifying it against a trusted local value. This allows a remote attacker to trick a victim into visiting a malicious callback URL, which can result in the attacker's account being linked to the victim's internal account. | CVSS Score 6.3 (MEDIUM)                                                                                          </description>

      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[The vulnerability affects Ignition SCADA applications where Python 
scripting is utilized for automation purposes. The vulnerability arises 
from the absence of proper security controls that restrict which Python 
libraries can be imported and executed within the scripting environment.
 The core issue lies in the Ignition service account having system 
permissions beyond what an Ignition privileged user requires. When an 
authenticated administrator uploads a malicious project file containing 
Python scripts with bind shell capabilities, the application executes 
these scripts with the same privileges as the Ignition Gateway process, 
which typically runs with SYSTEM-level permissions on Windows. 
Alternative code execution patterns could lead to similar results. | CVSS Score 6.4 (MEDIUM)</description>

      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network via the mDNS/DNS-SD protocol suite. In versions up to and including 0.9-rc2, the simple protocol server ignores the documented client limit and accepts unlimited connections, allowing for easy local DoS. Although `CLIENTS_MAX` is defined, `server_work()` unconditionally `accept()`s and `client_new()` always appends the new client and increments `n_clients`. There is no check against the limit. When client cannot be accepted as a result of maximal socket number of avahi-daemon, it logs unconditionally error per each connection. Unprivileged local users can exhaust daemon memory and file descriptors, causing a denial of service system-wide for mDNS/DNS-SD. Exhausting local file descriptors causes increased system load caused by logging errors of each of request. Overloading prevents glibc calls using nss-mdns plugins to resolve `*.local.` names and link-local addresses. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available, but a candidate fix is available in pull request 808, and some workarounds are available. Simple clients are offered for nss-mdns package functionality. It is not possible to disable the unix socket `/run/avahi-daemon/socket`, but resolution requests received via DBus are not affected directly. Tools avahi-resolve, avahi-resolve-address and avahi-resolve-host-name are not affected, they use DBus interface. It is possible to change permissions of unix socket after avahi-daemon is started. But avahi-daemon does not provide any configuration for it. Additional access restrictions like SELinux can also prevent unwanted tools to access the socket and keep resolution working for trusted users. | CVSS Score 5.5 (MEDIUM)                                                                                                                    </description>

      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[The Socket Appender in Apache Log4j Core versions 2.0-beta9 through 2.25.2 does not perform TLS hostname verification of the peer certificate, even when the  verifyHostName https//logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/appenders/network.html#SslConfiguration-attr-verifyHostName  configuration attribute or the  log4j2.sslVerifyHostName https//logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/systemproperties.html#log4j2.sslVerifyHostName  system property is set to true.

This issue may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to intercept or redirect log traffic under the following conditions

  *  The attacker is able to intercept or redirect network traffic between the client and the log receiver.
  *  The attacker can present a server certificate issued by a certification authority trusted by the Socket Appender’s configured trust store (or by the default Java trust store if no custom trust store is configured).


Users are advised to upgrade to Apache Log4j Core version 2.25.3, which addresses this issue.

As an alternative mitigation, the Socket Appender may be configured to use a private or restricted trust root to limit the set of trusted certificates. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>

usb typec ucsi fix use-after-free caused by uec->work

The delayed work uec->work is scheduled in gaokun_ucsi_probe()
but never properly canceled in gaokun_ucsi_remove(). This creates
use-after-free scenarios where the ucsi and gaokun_ucsi structure
are freed after ucsi_destroy() completes execution, while the
gaokun_ucsi_register_worker() might be either currently executing
or still pending in the work queue. The already-freed gaokun_ucsi
or ucsi structure may then be accessed.

Furthermore, the race window is 3 seconds, which is sufficiently
long to make this bug easily reproducible. The following is the

      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

scsi imm Fix use-after-free bug caused by unfinished delayed work

The delayed work item 'imm_tq' is initialized in imm_attach() and
scheduled via imm_queuecommand() for processing SCSI commands.  When the
IMM parallel port SCSI host adapter is detached through imm_detach(),
the imm_struct device instance is deallocated.

However, the delayed work might still be pending or executing
when imm_detach() is called, leading to use-after-free bugs
when the work function imm_interrupt() accesses the already
freed imm_struct memory.

The race condition can occur as follows

CPU 0(detach thread)   | CPU 1
                       | imm_queuecommand()
                       |   imm_queuecommand_lck()
imm_detach()           |     schedule_delayed_work()
  kfree(dev) //FREE    | imm_interrupt()
                       |   dev = container_of(...) //USE
                           dev-> //USE

Add disable_delayed_work_sync() in imm_detach() to guarantee proper
cancellation of the delayed work item before imm_struct is deallocated. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>

      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

net/sched sch_cake Fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop

In cake_drop(), qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is used to update the qlen
and backlog of the qdisc hierarchy. Its caller, cake_enqueue(), assumes
that the parent qdisc will enqueue the current packet. However, this
assumption breaks when cake_enqueue() returns NET_XMIT_CN the parent
qdisc stops enqueuing current packet, leaving the tree qlen/backlog
accounting inconsistent. This mismatch can lead to a NULL dereference
(e.g., when the parent Qdisc is qfq_qdisc).

This patch computes the qlen/backlog delta in a more robust way by
observing the difference before and after the series of cake_drop()
calls, and then compensates the qdisc tree accounting if cake_enqueue()
returns NET_XMIT_CN.

To ensure correct compensation when ACK thinning is enabled, a new
variable is introduced to keep qlen unchanged. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>

The server‑side API allows device association using a set of identifiers "device", "sku", "type", and a client‑computed "value", that are not cryptographically bound to a secret originating from the device itself.

The vulnerability has been verified for the Govee H6056 - lamp device in firmware version 1.08.13, but may affect also other Govee cloud‑connected devices. The vendor is not able to provide a list of affected products, but rolls out a firmware and server-side fixes. Devices that reached end‑of‑life for security support need replacement with newer models supporting updates. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>
