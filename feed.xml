<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47948
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 17, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 8 hours, 58 minutes ago

<strong>Description : </strong>Cocotais Bot is a QQ official robot framework based on qq-bot-sdk. Starting in version 1.5.0-test2-hotfix and prior to version 1.6.2, command echoing feature in the framework allows users to indirectly trigger privileged behavior by injecting special platform tags. Specifically, an unauthorized user can use the `/echo <qqbot-at-everyone />` command to cause the bot to send a message that mentions all members in the chat, bypassing any permission controls. This can lead to spam, disruption, or abuse of notification systems. Version 1.6.2 contains a patch for the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-22233 - Spring Framework Disallowed Fields Bypass Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-22233
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 16, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 57 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>CVE-2024-38820 ensured Locale-independent, lowercase conversion for both the configured disallowedFields patterns and for request parameter names. However, there are still cases where it is possible to bypass the disallowedFields checks.

Affected Spring Products and Versions

Spring Framework:
  *  6.2.0 - 6.2.6

  *  6.1.0 - 6.1.19

  *  6.0.0 - 6.0.27

  *  5.3.0 - 5.3.42
  *  Older, unsupported versions are also affected



Mitigation

Users of affected versions should upgrade to the corresponding fixed version.

Affected version(s)Fix Version Availability 6.2.x
 6.2.7
OSS6.1.x
 6.1.20
OSS6.0.x
 6.0.28
 Commercial https://enterprise.spring.io/ 5.3.x
 5.3.43
 Commercial https://enterprise.spring.io/ 
No further mitigation steps are necessary.


Generally, we recommend using a dedicated model object with properties only for data binding, or using constructor binding since constructor arguments explicitly declare what to bind together with turning off setter binding through the declarativeBinding flag. See the Model Design section in the reference documentation.

For setting binding, prefer the use of allowedFields (an explicit list) over disallowedFields.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-4476
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 16, 2025, 6:16 p.m. | 10 hours, 3 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A denial-of-service vulnerability has been identified in the libsoup HTTP client library. This flaw can be triggered when a libsoup client receives a 401 (Unauthorized) HTTP response containing a specifically crafted domain parameter within the WWW-Authenticate header. Processing this malformed header can lead to a crash of the client application using libsoup. An attacker could exploit this by setting up a malicious HTTP server. If a user's application using the vulnerable libsoup library connects to this malicious server, it could result in a denial-of-service. Successful exploitation requires tricking a user's client application into connecting to the attacker's malicious server.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32962
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 16, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework built on top of Flask. Versions prior to 4.6.2 would allow for a malicious unauthenticated actor to perform an open redirect by manipulating the Host header in HTTP requests. Flask-AppBuilder 4.6.2 introduced the `FAB_SAFE_REDIRECT_HOSTS` configuration variable, which allows administrators to explicitly define which domains are considered safe for redirection. As a workaround, use a reverse proxy to enforce trusted host headers.

      <title>CVE-2025-47790 - Nextcloud Session Skipped Second Factor Confirmation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47790
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 16, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Nextcloud Server is a self hosted personal cloud system. Nextcloud Server prior to 29.0.15, 30.0.9, and 31.0.3 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server prior to 26.0.13.15, 27.1.11.15, 28.0.14.6, 29.0.15, 30.0.9, and 31.0.3 have a bug with session handling. The bug caused skipping the second factor confirmation after a successful login with the username and password when the server was configured with `remember_login_cookie_lifetime` set to `0`, once the session expired on the page to select the second factor and the page is reloaded. Nextcloud Server 29.0.15, 30.0.9, and 31.0.3 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 26.0.13.15, 27.1.11.15, 28.0.14.6, 29.0.15, 30.0.9 and 31.0.3 contain a patch. As a workaround, set the `remember_login_cookie_lifetime` in config.php to a value other than `0`, e.g. `900`. Beware that this is only a workaround for new sessions created after the configuration change. System administration can delete affected sessions.

      <title>CVE-2025-37890 - Linux Kernel net_sched hfsc UAF Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37890
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 16, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: hfsc: Fix a UAF vulnerability in class with netem as child qdisc

As described in Gerrard's report [1], we have a UAF case when an hfsc class
has a netem child qdisc. The crux of the issue is that hfsc is assuming
that checking for cl->qdisc->q.qlen == 0 guarantees that it hasn't inserted
the class in the vttree or eltree (which is not true for the netem
duplicate case).

This patch checks the n_active class variable to make sure that the code
won't insert the class in the vttree or eltree twice, catering for the
reentrant case.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47930
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 16, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 6 hours, 9 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Zulip is an open-source team chat application. Starting in version 10.0 and prior to version 10.3, the "Who can create public channels" access control mechanism can be circumvented by creating a private or web-public channel, and then changing the channel privacy to public. A similar technique works for creating private channels without permission, though such a process requires either the API or modifying the HTML, as we do mark the "private" radio button as disabled in such cases. Version 10.3 contains a patch.

      <title>CVE-2025-47287 - Tornado Multipart Form Data Denial of Service Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47287
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 15, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. When Tornado's ``multipart/form-data`` parser encounters certain errors, it logs a warning but continues trying to parse the remainder of the data. This allows remote attackers to generate an extremely high volume of logs, constituting a DoS attack. This DoS is compounded by the fact that the logging subsystem is synchronous. All versions of Tornado prior to 6.5.0 are affected. The vulnerable parser is enabled by default. Upgrade to Tornado version 6.50 to receive a patch. As a workaround, risk can be mitigated by blocking `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` in a proxy.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Spotipy is a Python library for the Spotify Web API. As of commit 4f5759dbfb4506c7b6280572a4db1aabc1ac778d, using `pull_request_target` on `.github/workflows/integration_tests.yml` followed by the checking out the head.sha of a forked PR can be exploited by attackers, since untrusted code can be executed having full access to secrets (from the base repo). By exploiting the vulnerability is possible to exfiltrate `GITHUB_TOKEN` and secrets `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`,  `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET`. In particular `GITHUB_TOKEN` which can be used to completely overtake the repo since the token has content write privileges. The `pull_request_target` in GitHub Actions is a major security concern—especially in public repositories—because it executes untrusted code from a PR, but with the context of the base repository, including access to its secrets. Commit 9dfb7177b8d7bb98a5a6014f8e6436812a47576f reverted the change that caused the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-46834 - Alchemy's Modular Account Allowlist Bypass Vulnerability (Authorization Issue)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46834
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 15, 2025, 8:16 p.m. | 2 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Alchemy's Modular Account is a smart contract account that is compatible with ERC-4337 and ERC-6900. In versions on the 2.x branch prior to commit 5e6f540d249afcaeaf76ab95517d0359fde883b0, owners of Modular Accounts can grant session keys (scoped external keys) to external parties and would use the allowlist module to restrict which external contracts can be accessed by the session key. There is a bug in the allowlist module in that we don't check for the `executeUserOp` -> `execute` or `executeBatch` path, effectively allowing any session key to bypass any access control restrictions set on the session key. Session keys are able to access ERC20 and ERC721 token contracts amongst others, transferring all tokens from the account out andonfigure the permissions on external modules on session keys. They would be able to remove all restrictions set on themselves this way, or rotate the keys of other keys with higher privileges into keys that they control. Commit 5e6f540d249afcaeaf76ab95517d0359fde883b0 fixes this issue.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 15, 2025, 8:16 p.m. | 2 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Emlog is an open source website building system. In versions up to and including 2.5.9, SQL injection occurs because the $origContent parameter in admin/article_save.php is not strictly filtered. Since admin/article_save.php can be accessed by ordinary registered users, this will cause SQL injection to occur when the registered site is enabled, resulting in the injection of the admin account and password, which is then exploited by the backend remote code execution. As of time of publication, it is unknown whether a fix exists.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The WebAssembly Micro Runtime's (WAMR) iwasm package is the executable binary built with WAMR VMcore which supports WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) and command line interface. Anyone running WAMR up to and including version 2.2.0 or WAMR built with libc-uvwasi on Windows is affected by a symlink following vulnerability. On WAMR running in Windows, creating a symlink pointing outside of the preopened directory and subsequently opening it with create flag will create a file on host outside of the sandbox. If the symlink points to an existing host file, it's also possible to open it and read its content. Version 2.3.0 fixes the issue.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client for Node.js. Prior to versions 5.29.0, 6.21.2, and 7.5.0, applications that use undici to implement a webhook-like system are vulnerable. If the attacker set up a server with an invalid certificate, and they can force the application to call the webhook repeatedly, then they can cause a memory leak. This has been patched in versions 5.29.0, 6.21.2, and 7.5.0. As a workaound, avoid calling a webhook repeatedly if the webhook fails.

      <title>CVE-2025-47285 - Vyper Ethereum Virtual Machine Side-Effect Evaluation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47285
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 15, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Vyper is the Pythonic Programming Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. In versions up to and including 0.4.2rc1, `concat()` may skip evaluation of side effects when the length of an argument is zero. This is due to a fastpath in the implementation which skips evaluation of argument expressions when their length is zero. In practice, it would be very unusual in user code to construct zero-length bytestrings using an expression with side-effects, since zero-length bytestrings are typically constructed with the empty literal `b""`; the only way to construct an empty bytestring which has side effects would be with the ternary operator introduced in v0.3.8, e.g. `b"" if self.do_some_side_effect() else b""`. The fix is available in pull request 4644 and expected to be part of the 0.4.2 release. As a workaround, don't have side effects in expressions which construct zero-length bytestrings.

      <title>CVE-2025-47774 - Vyper Uninitialized Side Effect Elision in Slice Builtin</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47774
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 15, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Vyper is the Pythonic Programming Language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. In versions up to and including 0.4.2rc1, the `slice()` builtin can elide side effects when the output length is 0, and the source bytestring is a builtin (`msg.data` or `<address>.code`). The reason is that for these source locations, the check that `length >= 1` is skipped. The result is that a 0-length bytestring constructed with slice can be passed to `make_byte_array_copier`, which elides evaluation of its source argument when the max length is 0. The impact is that side effects in the `start` argument may be elided when the `length` argument is 0, e.g. `slice(msg.data, self.do_side_effect(), 0)`. The fix in pull request 4645 disallows any invocation of `slice()` with length 0, including for the ad hoc locations discussed in this advisory. The fix is expected to be part of version 0.4.2.

      <title>CVE-2025-32421 - Next.js Race Condition Page Prop Exposure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32421
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 14, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 13 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Versions prior to 14.2.24 and 15.1.6 have a race-condition vulnerability. This issue only affects the Pages Router under certain misconfigurations, causing normal endpoints to serve `pageProps` data instead of standard HTML. This issue was patched in versions 15.1.6 and 14.2.24 by stripping the `x-now-route-matches` header from incoming requests. Applications hosted on Vercel's platform are not affected by this issue, as the platform does not cache responses based solely on `200 OK` status without explicit `cache-control` headers. Those who self-host Next.js deployments and are unable to upgrade immediately can mitigate this vulnerability by stripping the `x-now-route-matches` header from all incoming requests at the content development network and setting `cache-control: no-store` for all responses under risk. The maintainers of Next.js strongly recommend only caching responses with explicit cache-control headers.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 14, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 13 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>net-tools is a collection of programs that form the base set of the NET-3 networking distribution for the Linux operating system. Inn versions up to and including 2.10, the Linux network utilities (like ifconfig) from the net-tools package do not properly validate the structure of /proc files when showing interfaces. `get_name()` in `interface.c` copies interface labels from `/proc/net/dev` into a fixed 16-byte stack buffer without bounds checking, leading to possible arbitrary code execution or crash. The known attack path does not require privilege but also does not provide privilege escalation in this scenario. A patch is available and expected to be part of version 2.20.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-0133
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 14, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 38 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the GlobalProtect™ gateway and portal features of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS® software enables execution of malicious JavaScript in the context of an authenticated Captive Portal user's browser when they click on a specially crafted link. The primary risk is phishing attacks that can lead to credential theft—particularly if you enabled Clientless VPN.

There is no availability impact to GlobalProtect features or GlobalProtect users. Attackers cannot use this vulnerability to tamper with or modify contents or configurations of the GlobalProtect portal or gateways. The integrity impact of this vulnerability is limited to enabling an attacker to create phishing and credential-stealing links that appear to be hosted on the GlobalProtect portal.



For GlobalProtect users with Clientless VPN enabled, there is a limited impact on confidentiality due to inherent risks of Clientless VPN that facilitate credential theft. You can read more about this risk in the informational bulletin  PAN-SA-2025-0005 https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/PAN-SA-2025-0005   https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/PAN-SA-2025-0005 . There is no impact to confidentiality for GlobalProtect users if you did not enable (or you disable) Clientless VPN.

      <title>CVE-2025-47781 - Rallly Token Brute Force Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47781
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 14, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 51 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Rallly is an open-source scheduling and collaboration tool. Versions up to and including 3.22.1 of the application features token based authentication. When a user attempts to login to the application, they insert their email and a 6 digit code is sent to their email address to complete the authentication. A token that consists of 6 digits only presents weak entropy however and when coupled with no token brute force protection, makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of a valid email address to successfully brute force the token within 15 minutes (token expiration time) and take over the account associated with the targeted email address. All users on the Rallly applications are impacted. As long as an attacker knows the user's email address they used to register on the app, they can systematically take over any user account. For the authentication mechanism to be safe, the token would need to be assigned a complex high entropy value that cannot be bruteforced within reasonable time, and ideally rate limiting the /api/auth/callback/email endpoint to further make brute force attempts unreasonable within the 15 minutes time. As of time of publication, no patched versions are available.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2023-53146
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 14, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 51 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: dw2102: Fix null-ptr-deref in dw2102_i2c_transfer()

In dw2102_i2c_transfer, msg is controlled by user. When msg[i].buf
is null and msg[i].len is zero, former checks on msg[i].buf would be
passed. Malicious data finally reach dw2102_i2c_transfer. If accessing
msg[i].buf[0] without sanity check, null ptr deref would happen.
We add check on msg[i].len to prevent crash.

      <title>CVE-2025-3931 - Yggdrasil DBus Unauthenticated Command Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3931
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 14, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 51 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A flaw was found in Yggdrasil, which acts as a system broker, allowing the processes to communicate to other children's "worker" processes through the DBus component. Yggdrasil creates a DBus method to dispatch messages to workers. However, it misses authentication and authorization checks, allowing every system user to call it. One available Yggdrasil worker acts as a package manager with capabilities to create and enable new repositories and install or remove packages. 

This flaw allows an attacker with access to the system to leverage the lack of authentication on the dispatch message to force the Yggdrasil worker to install arbitrary RPM packages. This issue results in local privilege escalation, enabling the attacker to access and modify sensitive system data.

      <title>CVE-2025-47280 - Umbraco Forms Email Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47280
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 13, 2025, 5:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Umbraco Forms is a form builder that integrates with the Umbraco content management system. Starting in the 7.x branch and prior to versions 13.4.2 and 15.1.2, the 'Send email' workflow does not HTML encode the user-provided field values in the sent email message, making any form with this workflow configured vulnerable, as it allows sending the message from a trusted system and address, potentially bypassing spam and email client security systems. This issue affects all (supported) versions Umbraco Forms and is patched in 13.4.2 and 15.1.2. Unpatched or unsupported versions can workaround this issue by using the `Send email with template (Razor)` workflow instead or writing a custom workflow type. To avoid accidentally using the vulnerable workflow again, the `SendEmail` workflow type can be removed using a composer available in the GitHub Security Advisory for this vulnerability.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-4658
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 13, 2025, 5:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Versions of OpenPubkey library prior to 0.10.0  contained a vulnerability that would allow a specially crafted JWS to bypass signature verification.

      <title>CVE-2025-30207 - "Kirby PHP Built-in Server Path Traversal Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30207
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 13, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Kirby is an open-source content management system. A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.9.8.3, 3.10.1.2, and 4.7.1 affects all Kirby setups that use PHP's built-in server. Such setups are commonly only used during local development. Sites that use other server software (such as Apache, nginx or Caddy) are not affected. A missing path traversal check allowed attackers to navigate all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including files outside of the Kirby installation. The vulnerable implementation delegated all existing files to PHP, including existing files outside of the document root. This leads to a different response that allows attackers to determine whether the requested file exists. Because Kirby's router only delegates such requests to PHP and does not load or execute them, contents of the files were not exposed as PHP treats requests to files outside of the document root as invalid. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.9.8.3, Kirby 3.10.1.2, and Kirby 4.7.1. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers of Kirby have updated the router to check if existing static files are within the document root. Requests to files outside the document root are treated as page requests of the error page and will no longer allow to determine whether the file exists or not.

      <title>CVE-2025-31493 - Kirby Path Traversal and Code Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-31493
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 13, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Kirby is an open-source content management system. A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.9.8.3, 3.10.1.2, and 4.7.1 affects all Kirby sites that use the `collection()` helper or `$kirby->collection()` method with a dynamic collection name (such as a collection name that depends on request or user data). Sites that only use fixed calls to the `collection()` helper/`$kirby->collection()` method (i.e. calls with a simple string for the collection name) are *not* affected. A missing path traversal check allowed attackers to navigate and access all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including files outside of the collections root or even outside of the Kirby installation. PHP code within such files was executed. Such attacks first require an attack vector in the site code that is caused by dynamic collection names, such as `collection('tags-' . get('tags'))`. It generally also requires knowledge of the site structure and the server's file system by the attacker, although it can be possible to find vulnerable setups through automated methods such as fuzzing. In a vulnerable setup, this could cause damage to the confidentiality and integrity of the server. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.9.8.3, Kirby 3.10.1.2, and Kirby 4.7.1. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers of Kirby have added a check for the collection path that ensures that the resulting path is contained within the configured collections root. Collection paths that point outside of the collections root will not be loaded.

      <title>CVE-2025-46721 - Apache NOSurf CSRF Bypass Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46721
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 13, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>nosurf is cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection middleware for Go. A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on user's behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` header in the request).

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47276
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 13, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Actualizer is a single shell script solution to allow developers and embedded engineers to create Debian operating systems (OS). Prior to version 1.2.0, Actualizer uses OpenSSL's  "-passwd" function, which uses SHA512 instead of a more suitable password hasher like Yescript/Argon2i. All Actualizer users building a full Debian Operating System are affected. Users should upgrade to version 1.2.0 of Actualizer. Existing OS deployment requires manual password changes against the alpha and root accounts. The change will deploy's Debian's yescript overriding the older SHA512 hash created by OpenSSL. As a workaround, users need to reset both `root` and "Alpha" users' passwords.

      <title>CVE-2025-47278 - Flask itsdangerous Incorrect Fallback Key Configuration Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47278
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 13, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Flask is a web server gateway interface (WSGI) web application framework. In Flask 3.1.0, the way fallback key configuration was handled resulted in the last fallback key being used for signing, rather than the current signing key. Signing is provided by the `itsdangerous` library. A list of keys can be passed, and it expects the last (top) key in the list to be the most recent key, and uses that for signing. Flask was incorrectly constructing that list in reverse, passing the signing key first. Sites that have opted-in to use key rotation by setting `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` care likely to unexpectedly be signing their sessions with stale keys, and their transition to fresher keys will be impeded. Sessions are still signed, so this would not cause any sort of data integrity loss. Version 3.1.1 contains a patch for the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-30159 - Kirby Path Traversal and Code Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30159
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 13, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Kirby is an open-source content management system. A vulnerability in versions prior to 3.9.8.3, 3.10.1.2, and 4.7.1 affects all Kirby sites that use the `snippet()` helper or `$kirby->snippet()` method with a dynamic snippet name (such as a snippet name that depends on request or user data). Sites that only use fixed calls to the `snippet()` helper/`$kirby->snippet()` method (i.e. calls with a simple string for the snippet name) are *not* affected. A missing path traversal check allowed attackers to navigate and access all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including files outside of the snippets root or even outside of the Kirby installation. PHP code within such files was executed. Such attacks first require an attack vector in the site code that is caused by dynamic snippet names, such as `snippet('tags-' . get('tags'))`. It generally also requires knowledge of the site structure and the server's file system by the attacker, although it can be possible to find vulnerable setups through automated methods such as fuzzing. In a vulnerable setup, this could cause damage to the confidentiality and integrity of the server. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.9.8.3, Kirby 3.10.1.2, and Kirby 4.7.1. In all of the mentioned releases, Kirby maintainers have added a check for the snippet path that ensures that the resulting path is contained within the configured snippets root. Snippet paths that point outside of the snippets root will not be loaded.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46825
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 12, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 28 minutes ago

<strong>Description : </strong>Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. Versions 1.2.26 through 1.2.44 have a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in the `name` parameter of the `http://localhost/?controller=ProjectCreationController&action=create` form. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Note that the default content security policy (CSP) blocks the JavaScript attack, though it can be exploited if an instance is badly configured and the software is vulnerable to CSS injection because of the unsafe-inline on the default CSP. Version 1.2.45 contains a fix for the issue.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46717
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 12, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>sudo-rs is a memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust. Prior to version 0.2.6, users with no (or very limited) sudo privileges can determine whether files exists in folders that they otherwise cannot access using `sudo --list <pathname>`. Users with local access to a machine can discover the existence/non-existence of certain files, revealing potentially sensitive information in the file names. This information can also be used in conjunction with other attacks. Version 0.2.6 fixes the vulnerability.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46718
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 12, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>sudo-rs is a memory safe implementation of sudo and su written in Rust. Prior to version 0.2.6, users with limited sudo privileges (e.g. execution of a single command) can list sudo privileges of other users using the `-U` flag. This vulnerability allows users with limited sudo privileges to enumerate the sudoers file, revealing sensitive information about other users' permissions. Attackers can collect information that can be used to more targeted attacks. Systems where users either do not have sudo privileges or have the ability to run all commands as root through sudo (the default configuration on most systems) are not affected by this advisory. Version 0.2.6 fixes the vulnerability.

      <title>CVE-2025-47274 - ToolHive Inadvertent Secrets Storage Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47274
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 12, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ToolHive is a utility designed to simplify the deployment and management of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Due to the ordering of code used to start an MCP server container, versions of ToolHive prior to 0.0.33 inadvertently store secrets in the run config files which are used to restart stopped containers. This means that an attacker who has access to the home folder of the user who starts the MCP server can read secrets without needing access to the secrets store itself. This only applies to secrets which were used in containers whose run configs exist at a point in time - other secrets remaining inaccessible. ToolHive 0.0.33 fixes the issue. Some workarounds are available. Stop and delete any running MCP servers, or manually remove any runconfigs from `$HOME/Library/Application Support/toolhive/runconfigs/` (macOS) or `$HOME/.state/toolhive/runconfigs/` (Linux).

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 12, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>EspoCRM is a free, open-source customer relationship management platform. Prior to version 9.0.8, HTML Injection in Knowledge Base (KB) articles leads to complete page defacement imitating the login page. Authenticated users with the read knowledge article privilege can browse to the KB article and if they submit their credentials, they get captured in plain text. The vulnerability is allowed by overly permissive HTML editing being allowed on the KB articles. Any authenticated user with the privilege to read KB articles is impacted. In an enterprise with multiple applications, the malicious KB article could be edited to match the login pages of other applications, which would make it useful for credential harvesting against other applications as well. Version 9.0.8 contains a patch for the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-47270 - Nimiq Albatross Denial of Service Buffer Overflow</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47270
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 12, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>nimiq/core-rs-albatross is a Rust implementation of the Nimiq Proof-of-Stake protocol based on the Albatross consensus algorithm. The `nimiq-network-libp2p` subcrate of nimiq/core-rs-albatross is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to uncontrolled memory allocation. Specifically, the implementation of the `Discovery` network message handling allocates a buffer based on a length value provided by the peer, without enforcing an upper bound. Since this length is a `u32`, a peer can trigger allocations of up to 4 GB, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and node crashes. As Discovery messages are regularly exchanged for peer discovery, this vulnerability can be exploited repeatedly. The patch for this vulnerability is formally released as part of v1.1.0. The patch implements a limit to the discovery message size of 1 MB and also resizes the message buffer size incrementally as the data is read. No known workarounds are available.

      <title>CVE-2025-47269 - Code-server Proxy Pathway Token Exfiltration</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47269
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 9, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 14 hours, 23 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>code-server runs VS Code on any machine anywhere through browser access. Prior to version 4.99.4, a maliciously crafted URL using the proxy subpath can result in the attacker gaining access to the session token. Failure to properly validate the port for a proxy request can result in proxying to an arbitrary domain. The malicious URL `https://<code-server>/proxy/test@evil.com/path` would be proxied to `test@evil.com/path` where the attacker could exfiltrate a user's session token. Any user who runs code-server with the built-in proxy enabled and clicks on maliciously crafted links that go to their code-server instances with reference to /proxy. Normally this is used to proxy local ports, however the URL can reference the attacker's domain instead, and the connection is then proxied to that domain, which will include sending cookies. With access to the session cookie, the attacker can then log into code-server and have full access to the machine hosting code-server as the user running code-server. This issue has been patched in version 4.99.4.

      <title>CVE-2025-4382 - GRUB TPM Auto- decryption Data Exposure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-4382
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 9, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 16 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A flaw was found in systems utilizing LUKS-encrypted disks with GRUB configured for TPM-based auto-decryption. When GRUB is set to automatically decrypt disks using keys stored in the TPM, it reads the decryption key into system memory. If an attacker with physical access can corrupt the underlying filesystem superblock, GRUB will fail to locate a valid filesystem and enter rescue mode. At this point, the disk is already decrypted, and the decryption key remains loaded in system memory. This scenario may allow an attacker with physical access to access the unencrypted data without any further authentication, thereby compromising data confidentiality. Furthermore, the ability to force this state through filesystem corruption also presents a data integrity concern.

      <title>CVE-2025-46392 - Apache Commons Configuration Uncontrolled Resource Consumption Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46392
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 9, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache Commons Configuration 1.x.

There are a number of issues in Apache Commons Configuration 1.x that allow excessive resource consumption when loading untrusted configurations or using unexpected usage patterns. The Apache Commons Configuration team does not intend to fix these issues in 1.x. Apache Commons Configuration 1.x is still safe to use in scenario's where you only load trusted configurations. 


Users that load untrusted configurations or give attackers control over usage patterns are recommended to upgrade to the 2.x version line, which fixes these issues. Apache Commons Configuration 2.x is not a drop-in replacement, but as it uses a separate Maven groupId and Java package namespace they can be loaded side-by-side, making it possible to do a gradual migration.

      <title>CVE-2025-37885 - KVM Linux Kernel MSI Route Handling Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37885
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 9, 2025, 7:16 a.m. | 8 hours, 45 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: Reset IRTE to host control if *new* route isn't postable

Restore an IRTE back to host control (remapped or posted MSI mode) if the
*new* GSI route prevents posting the IRQ directly to a vCPU, regardless of
the GSI routing type.  Updating the IRTE if and only if the new GSI is an
MSI results in KVM leaving an IRTE posting to a vCPU.

The dangling IRTE can result in interrupts being incorrectly delivered to
the guest, and in the worst case scenario can result in use-after-free,
e.g. if the VM is torn down, but the underlying host IRQ isn't freed.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37886
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 9, 2025, 7:16 a.m. | 8 hours, 45 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pds_core: make wait_context part of q_info

Make the wait_context a full part of the q_info struct rather
than a stack variable that goes away after pdsc_adminq_post()
is done so that the context is still available after the wait
loop has given up.

There was a case where a slow development firmware caused
the adminq request to time out, but then later the FW finally
finished the request and sent the interrupt.  The handler tried
to complete_all() the completion context that had been created
on the stack in pdsc_adminq_post() but no longer existed.
This caused bad pointer usage, kernel crashes, and much wailing
and gnashing of teeth.

      <title>CVE-2025-37887 - Linux Kernel PDS_CORE Devlink Command Buffer Overflow</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37887
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 9, 2025, 7:16 a.m. | 8 hours, 45 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pds_core: handle unsupported PDS_CORE_CMD_FW_CONTROL result

If the FW doesn't support the PDS_CORE_CMD_FW_CONTROL command
the driver might at the least print garbage and at the worst
crash when the user runs the "devlink dev info" devlink command.

This happens because the stack variable fw_list is not 0
initialized which results in fw_list.num_fw_slots being a
garbage value from the stack.  Then the driver tries to access
fw_list.fw_names[i] with i >= ARRAY_SIZE and runs off the end
of the array.

Fix this by initializing the fw_list and by not failing
completely if the devcmd fails because other useful information
is printed via devlink dev info even if the devcmd fails.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37889
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 9, 2025, 7:16 a.m. | 8 hours, 45 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI/MSI: Handle the NOMASK flag correctly for all PCI/MSI backends

The conversion of the XEN specific global variable pci_msi_ignore_mask to a
MSI domain flag, missed the facts that:

    1) Legacy architectures do not provide a interrupt domain
    2) Parent MSI domains do not necessarily have a domain info attached
   
Both cases result in an unconditional NULL pointer dereference. This was
unfortunatly missed in review and testing revealed it late.

Cure this by using the existing pci_msi_domain_supports() helper, which
handles all possible cases correctly.

      <title>CVE-2025-37884 - Linux Kernel BPF Event Mutex Deadlock</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37884
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 9, 2025, 7:16 a.m. | 7 hours, 38 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix deadlock between rcu_tasks_trace and event_mutex.

Fix the following deadlock:
CPU A
_free_event()
  perf_kprobe_destroy()
    mutex_lock(&event_mutex)
      perf_trace_event_unreg()
        synchronize_rcu_tasks_trace()

There are several paths where _free_event() grabs event_mutex
and calls sync_rcu_tasks_trace. Above is one such case.

CPU B
bpf_prog_test_run_syscall()
  rcu_read_lock_trace()
    bpf_prog_run_pin_on_cpu()
      bpf_prog_load()
        bpf_tracing_func_proto()
          trace_set_clr_event()
            mutex_lock(&event_mutex)

Delegate trace_set_clr_event() to workqueue to avoid
such lock dependency.

      <title>CVE-2025-37882 - Linux Kernel USB xHCI Isochronous Ring Handling Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37882
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 9, 2025, 7:16 a.m. | 6 hours, 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: xhci: Fix isochronous Ring Underrun/Overrun event handling

The TRB pointer of these events points at enqueue at the time of error
occurrence on xHCI 1.1+ HCs or it's NULL on older ones. By the time we
are handling the event, a new TD may be queued at this ring position.

I can trigger this race by rising interrupt moderation to increase IRQ
handling delay. Similar delay may occur naturally due to system load.

If this ever happens after a Missed Service Error, missed TDs will be
skipped and the new TD processed as if it matched the event. It could
be given back prematurely, risking data loss or buffer UAF by the xHC.

Don't complete TDs on xrun events and don't warn if queued TDs don't
match the event's TRB pointer, which can be NULL or a link/no-op TRB.
Don't warn if there are no queued TDs at all.

Now that it's safe, also handle xrun events if the skip flag is clear.
This ensures completion of any TD stuck in 'error mid TD' state right
before the xrun event, which could happen if a driver submits a finite
number of URBs to a buggy HC and then an error occurs on the last TD.

      <title>CVE-2025-37877 - Linux Kernel IOMMU DMA Cleanup Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37877
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 9, 2025, 7:16 a.m. | 3 hours, 38 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu: Clear iommu-dma ops on cleanup

If iommu_device_register() encounters an error, it can end up tearing
down already-configured groups and default domains, however this
currently still leaves devices hooked up to iommu-dma (and even
historically the behaviour in this area was at best inconsistent across
architectures/drivers...) Although in the case that an IOMMU is present
whose driver has failed to probe, users cannot necessarily expect DMA to
work anyway, it's still arguable that we should do our best to put
things back as if the IOMMU driver was never there at all, and certainly
the potential for crashing in iommu-dma itself is undesirable. Make sure
we clean up the dev->dma_iommu flag along with everything else.

      <title>CVE-2025-37878 - Linux Kernel Perf Core Context Assignment Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37878
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 9, 2025, 7:16 a.m. | 3 hours, 38 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/core: Fix WARN_ON(!ctx) in __free_event() for partial init

Move the get_ctx(child_ctx) call and the child_event->ctx assignment to
occur immediately after the child event is allocated. Ensure that
child_event->ctx is non-NULL before any subsequent error path within
inherit_event calls free_event(), satisfying the assumptions of the
cleanup code.

Details:

There's no clear Fixes tag, because this bug is a side-effect of
multiple interacting commits over time (up to 15 years old), not
a single regression.

The code initially incremented refcount then assigned context
immediately after the child_event was created. Later, an early
validity check for child_event was added before the
refcount/assignment. Even later, a WARN_ON_ONCE() cleanup check was
added, assuming event->ctx is valid if the pmu_ctx is valid.
The problem is that the WARN_ON_ONCE() could trigger after the initial
check passed but before child_event->ctx was assigned, violating its
precondition. The solution is to assign child_event->ctx right after
its initial validation. This ensures the context exists for any
subsequent checks or cleanup routines, resolving the WARN_ON_ONCE().

To resolve it, defer the refcount update and child_event->ctx assignment
directly after child_event->pmu_ctx is set but before checking if the
parent event is orphaned. The cleanup routine depends on
event->pmu_ctx being non-NULL before it verifies event->ctx is
non-NULL. This also maintains the author's original intent of passing
in child_ctx to find_get_pmu_context before its refcount/assignment.

In p9_client_write() and p9_client_read_once(), if the server

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37880
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 9, 2025, 7:16 a.m. | 3 hours, 38 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

um: work around sched_yield not yielding in time-travel mode

sched_yield by a userspace may not actually cause scheduling in
time-travel mode as no time has passed. In the case seen it appears to
be a badly implemented userspace spinlock in ASAN. Unfortunately, with
time-travel it causes an extreme slowdown or even deadlock depending on
the kernel configuration (CONFIG_UML_MAX_USERSPACE_ITERATIONS).

Work around it by accounting time to the process whenever it executes a
sched_yield syscall.

      <title>CVE-2025-37875 - "Ionic Gigabit Controller (igc) PTM Trigger Logic Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37875
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 9, 2025, 7:16 a.m. | 2 hours, 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igc: fix PTM cycle trigger logic

Writing to clear the PTM status 'valid' bit while the PTM cycle is
triggered results in unreliable PTM operation. To fix this, clear the
PTM 'trigger' and status after each PTM transaction.

The issue can be reproduced with the following:

$ sudo phc2sys -R 1000 -O 0 -i tsn0 -m

Note: 1000 Hz (-R 1000) is unrealistically large, but provides a way to
quickly reproduce the issue.

PHC2SYS exits with:

"ioctl PTP_OFFSET_PRECISE: Connection timed out" when the PTM transaction
  fails

This patch also fixes a hang in igc_probe() when loading the igc
driver in the kdump kernel on systems supporting PTM.

The igc driver running in the base kernel enables PTM trigger in
igc_probe().  Therefore the driver is always in PTM trigger mode,
except in brief periods when manually triggering a PTM cycle.

When a crash occurs, the NIC is reset while PTM trigger is enabled.
Due to a hardware problem, the NIC is subsequently in a bad busmaster
state and doesn't handle register reads/writes.  When running
igc_probe() in the kdump kernel, the first register access to a NIC
register hangs driver probing and ultimately breaks kdump.

With this patch, igc has PTM trigger disabled most of the time,
and the trigger is only enabled for very brief (10 - 100 us) periods
when manually triggering a PTM cycle.  Chances that a crash occurs
during a PTM trigger are not 0, but extremely reduced.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37874
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 9, 2025, 7:16 a.m. | 1 hour, 15 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ngbe: fix memory leak in ngbe_probe() error path

When ngbe_sw_init() is called, memory is allocated for wx->rss_key
in wx_init_rss_key(). However, in ngbe_probe() function, the subsequent
error paths after ngbe_sw_init() don't free the rss_key. Fix that by
freeing it in error path along with wx->mac_table.

Also change the label to which execution jumps when ngbe_sw_init()
fails, because otherwise, it could lead to a double free for rss_key,
when the mac_table allocation fails in wx_sw_init().

      <title>CVE-2025-37871 - Linux Kernel NFSd Deadlock Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37871
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 9, 2025, 7:16 a.m. | 44 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: decrease sc_count directly if fail to queue dl_recall

A deadlock warning occurred when invoking nfs4_put_stid following a failed
dl_recall queue operation:
            T1                            T2
                                nfs4_laundromat
                                 nfs4_get_client_reaplist
                                  nfs4_anylock_blockers
__break_lease
 spin_lock // ctx->flc_lock
                                   spin_lock // clp->cl_lock
                                   nfs4_lockowner_has_blockers
                                    locks_owner_has_blockers
                                     spin_lock // flctx->flc_lock
 nfsd_break_deleg_cb
  nfsd_break_one_deleg
   nfs4_put_stid
    refcount_dec_and_lock
     spin_lock // clp->cl_lock

When a file is opened, an nfs4_delegation is allocated with sc_count
initialized to 1, and the file_lease holds a reference to the delegation.
The file_lease is then associated with the file through kernel_setlease.

The disassociation is performed in nfsd4_delegreturn via the following
call chain:
nfsd4_delegreturn --> destroy_delegation --> destroy_unhashed_deleg -->
nfs4_unlock_deleg_lease --> kernel_setlease --> generic_delete_lease
The corresponding sc_count reference will be released after this
disassociation.

Since nfsd_break_one_deleg executes while holding the flc_lock, the
disassociation process becomes blocked when attempting to acquire flc_lock
in generic_delete_lease. This means:
1) sc_count in nfsd_break_one_deleg will not be decremented to 0;
2) The nfs4_put_stid called by nfsd_break_one_deleg will not attempt to
acquire cl_lock;
3) Consequently, no deadlock condition is created.

Given that sc_count in nfsd_break_one_deleg remains non-zero, we can
safely perform refcount_dec on sc_count directly. This approach
effectively avoids triggering deadlock warnings.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46336
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 8, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Rack::Session is a session management implementation for Rack. In versions starting from 2.0.0 to before 2.1.1, when using the Rack::Session::Pool middleware, and provided the attacker can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue), the session may be restored if the attacker can trigger a long running request (within that same session) adjacent to the user logging out, in order to retain illicit access even after a user has attempted to logout. This issue has been patched in version 2.1.1.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46712
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 8, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language. In versions prior to OTP-27.3.4 (for OTP-27), OTP-26.2.5.12 (for OTP-26), and OTP-25.3.2.21 (for OTP-25), Erlang/OTP SSH fails to enforce strict KEX handshake hardening measures by allowing optional messages to be exchanged. This allows a Man-in-the-Middle attacker to inject these messages in a connection during the handshake. This issue has been patched in versions OTP-27.3.4 (for OTP-27), OTP-26.2.5.12 (for OTP-26), and OTP-25.3.2.21 (for OTP-25).

      <title>CVE-2025-44021 - OpenStack Ironic Unintended File Writing Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-44021
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 8, 2025, 5:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 38 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>OpenStack Ironic before 29.0.1 can write unintended files to a target node disk during image handling (if a deployment was performed via the API). A malicious project assigned as a node owner can provide a path to any local file (readable by ironic-conductor), which may then be written to the target node disk. This is difficult to exploit in practice, because a node deployed in this manner should never reach the ACTIVE state, but it still represents a danger in environments running with non-default, insecure configurations such as with automated cleaning disabled. The fixed versions are 24.1.3, 26.1.1, and 29.0.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-37832 - Allwinner cpufreq sun50i Linux Kernel Out-of-Bounds Read Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37832
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 8, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 8 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cpufreq: sun50i: prevent out-of-bounds access

A KASAN enabled kernel reports an out-of-bounds access when handling the
nvmem cell in the sun50i cpufreq driver:
==================================================================
BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in sun50i_cpufreq_nvmem_probe+0x180/0x3d4
Read of size 4 at addr ffff000006bf31e0 by task kworker/u16:1/38

This is because the DT specifies the nvmem cell as covering only two
bytes, but we use a u32 pointer to read the value. DTs for other SoCs
indeed specify 4 bytes, so we cannot just shorten the variable to a u16.

Fortunately nvmem_cell_read() allows to return the length of the nvmem
cell, in bytes, so we can use that information to only access the valid
portion of the data.
To cover multiple cell sizes, use memcpy() to copy the information into a
zeroed u32 buffer, then also make sure we always read the data in little
endian fashion, as this is how the data is stored in the SID efuses.

      <title>CVE-2025-37833 - Linux Niu PCI-MSIX Touch Entry Data Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37833
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 8, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 8 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/niu: Niu requires MSIX ENTRY_DATA fields touch before entry reads

Fix niu_try_msix() to not cause a fatal trap on sparc systems.

Set PCI_DEV_FLAGS_MSIX_TOUCH_ENTRY_DATA_FIRST on the struct pci_dev to
work around a bug in the hardware or firmware.

For each vector entry in the msix table, niu chips will cause a fatal
trap if any registers in that entry are read before that entries'
ENTRY_DATA register is written to. Testing indicates writes to other
registers are not sufficient to prevent the fatal trap, however the value
does not appear to matter. This only needs to happen once after power up,
so simply rebooting into a kernel lacking this fix will NOT cause the
trap.

I can reproduce this issue with the following steps:

1) When a dirty swapcache page is isolated by reclaim process and the
   page isn't locked, inject memory failure for the page. 
   me_swapcache_dirty() clears uptodate flag and tries to delete from lru,
   but fails.  Reclaim process will put the hwpoisoned page back to lru.

2) The process that maps the hwpoisoned page exits, the page is deleted
   the page will never be freed and will be in the lru forever.

3) If we trigger a reclaim again and tries to reclaim the page,
   add_to_swap() will trigger VM_BUG_ON_FOLIO due to the uptodate flag is
   cleared.

To fix it, skip the hwpoisoned page in shrink_folio_list().  Besides, the
hwpoison folio may not be unmapped by hwpoison_user_mappings() yet, unmap
it in shrink_folio_list(), otherwise the folio will fail to be unmaped by
hwpoison_user_mappings() since the folio isn't in lru list.

The 1st line is the most interesting here:

 BTRFS error (device sdc): zoned: write pointer offset mismatch of zones in raid1 profile

When a RAID1 block-group is created and a write pointer mismatch between
the disks in the RAID set is detected, btrfs sets the alloc_offset to the
length of the block group marking it as full. Afterwards the code expects
that a balance operation will evacuate the data in this block-group and
repair the problems.

But before this is possible, the new space of this block-group will be
accounted in the free space cache. But in __btrfs_

      <title>CVE-2025-37828 - "ufs Linux Kernel NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37828
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 8, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 7 hours, 14 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: mcq: Add NULL check in ufshcd_mcq_abort()

A race can occur between the MCQ completion path and the abort handler:
once a request completes, __blk_mq_free_request() sets rq->mq_hctx to
NULL, meaning the subsequent ufshcd_mcq_req_to_hwq() call in
ufshcd_mcq_abort() can return a NULL pointer. If this NULL pointer is
dereferenced, the kernel will crash.

Add a NULL check for the returned hwq pointer. If hwq is NULL, log an
error and return FAILED, preventing a potential NULL-pointer
dereference.  As suggested by Bart, the ufshcd_cmd_inflight() check is
removed.

This is similar to the fix in commit 74736103fb41 ("scsi: ufs: core: Fix
ufshcd_abort_one racing issue").

This is found by our static analysis tool KNighter.

      <title>CVE-2025-37825 - "Nvidia Nvmet Out-of-Bounds Access Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37825
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 8, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 6 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet: fix out-of-bounds access in nvmet_enable_port

When trying to enable a port that has no transport configured yet,
nvmet_enable_port() uses NVMF_TRTYPE_MAX (255) to query the transports
array, causing an out-of-bounds access:

[  106.058694] BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in nvmet_enable_port+0x42/0x1da
[  106.058719] Read of size 8 at addr ffffffff89dafa58 by task ln/632
[...]
[  106.076026] nvmet: transport type 255 not supported

Since commit 200adac75888, NVMF_TRTYPE_MAX is the default state as configured by
nvmet_ports_make().
Avoid this by checking for NVMF_TRTYPE_MAX before proceeding.

      <title>CVE-2025-37818 - LoongArch Linux Kernel Invalid PMD Pointer Dereference Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37818
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 8, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: Return NULL from huge_pte_offset() for invalid PMD

LoongArch's huge_pte_offset() currently returns a pointer to a PMD slot
even if the underlying entry points to invalid_pte_table (indicating no
mapping). Callers like smaps_hugetlb_range() fetch this invalid entry
value (the address of invalid_pte_table) via this pointer.

The generic is_swap_pte() check then incorrectly identifies this address
as a swap entry on LoongArch, because it satisfies the "!pte_present()
&& !pte_none()" conditions. This misinterpretation, combined with a
coincidental match by is_migration_entry() on the address bits, leads to
kernel crashes in pfn_swap_entry_to_page().

Fix this at the architecture level by modifying huge_pte_offset() to
check the PMD entry's content using pmd_none() before returning. If the
entry is invalid (i.e., it points to invalid_pte_table), return NULL
instead of the pointer to the slot.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37819
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 8, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

irqchip/gic-v2m: Prevent use after free of gicv2m_get_fwnode()

With ACPI in place, gicv2m_get_fwnode() is registered with the pci
subsystem as pci_msi_get_fwnode_cb(), which may get invoked at runtime
during a PCI host bridge probe. But, the call back is wrongly marked as
__init, causing it to be freed, while being registered with the PCI
subsystem and could trigger:

 Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff8000816c0400
  gicv2m_get_fwnode+0x0/0x58 (P)
  pci_set_bus_msi_domain+0x74/0x88
  pci_register_host_bridge+0x194/0x548

This is easily reproducible on a Juno board with ACPI boot.

Retain the function for later use.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37820
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 8, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen-netfront: handle NULL returned by xdp_convert_buff_to_frame()

The function xdp_convert_buff_to_frame() may return NULL if it fails
to correctly convert the XDP buffer into an XDP frame due to memory
constraints, internal errors, or invalid data. Failing to check for NULL
may lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the result is used later in
processing, potentially causing crashes, data corruption, or undefined
behavior.

On XDP redirect failure, the associated page must be released explicitly
if it was previously retained via get_page(). Failing to do so may result
in a memory leak, as the pages reference count is not decremented.

      <title>CVE-2025-37821 - Linux Kernel Sched Eevdf Crash</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37821
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 8, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/eevdf: Fix se->slice being set to U64_MAX and resulting crash

There is a code path in dequeue_entities() that can set the slice of a
sched_entity to U64_MAX, which sometimes results in a crash.

The offending case is when dequeue_entities() is called to dequeue a
delayed group entity, and then the entity's parent's dequeue is delayed.
In that case:

1. In the if (entity_is_task(se)) else block at the beginning of
   dequeue_entities(), slice is set to
   cfs_rq_min_slice(group_cfs_rq(se)). If the entity was delayed, then
   it has no queued tasks, so cfs_rq_min_slice() returns U64_MAX.
2. The first for_each_sched_entity() loop dequeues the entity.
3. If the entity was its parent's only child, then the next iteration
   tries to dequeue the parent.
4. If the parent's dequeue needs to be delayed, then it breaks from the
   first for_each_sched_entity() loop _without updating slice_.
5. The second for_each_sched_entity() loop sets the parent's ->slice to
   the saved slice, which is still U64_MAX.

This throws off subsequent calculations with potentially catastrophic
results. A manifestation we saw in production was:

6. In update_entity_lag(), se->slice is used to calculate limit, which
   ends up as a huge negative number.
7. limit is used in se->vlag = clamp(vlag, -limit, limit). Because limit
   is negative, vlag > limit, so se->vlag is set to the same huge
   negative number.
8. In place_entity(), se->vlag is scaled, which overflows and results in
   another huge (positive or negative) number.
9. The adjusted lag is subtracted from se->vruntime, which increases or
   decreases se->vruntime by a huge number.
10. pick_eevdf() calls entity_eligible()/vruntime_eligible(), which
    incorrectly returns false because the vruntime is so far from the
    other vruntimes on the queue, causing the
    (vruntime - cfs_rq->min_vruntime) * load calulation to overflow.
11. Nothing appears to be eligible, so pick_eevdf() returns NULL.
12. pick_next_entity() tries to dereference the return value of
    pick_eevdf() and crashes.

Dumping the cfs_rq states from the core dumps with drgn showed tell-tale
huge vruntime ranges and bogus vlag values, and I also traced se->slice
being set to U64_MAX on live systems (which was usually "benign" since
the rest of the runqueue needed to be in a particular state to crash).

Fix it in dequeue_entities() by always setting slice from the first
non-empty cfs_rq.

<strong>Published : </strong> May 8, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: uprobes: Add missing fence.i after building the XOL buffer

The XOL (execute out-of-line) buffer is used to single-step the

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: microchip: pci1xxxx: Fix Kernel panic during IRQ handler registration

Resolve kernel panic while accessing IRQ handler associated with the
generated IRQ. This is done by acquiring the spinlock and storing the
current interrupt state before handling the interrupt request using
generic_handle_irq.

A previous fix patch was submitted where 'generic_handle_irq' was
replaced with 'handle_nested_irq'. However, this change also causes
the kernel panic where after determining which GPIO triggered the
interrupt and attempting to call handle_nested_irq with the mapped
IRQ number, leads to a failure in locating the registered handler.

      <title>CVE-2025-37816 - Linux Kernel Mei VSC Buffer Overflow Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37816
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 8, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mei: vsc: Fix fortify-panic caused by invalid counted_by() use

gcc 15 honors the __counted_by(len) attribute on vsc_tp_packet.buf[]
and the vsc-tp.c code is using this in a wrong way. len does not contain
the available size in the buffer, it contains the actual packet length
*without* the crc. So as soon as vsc_tp_xfer() tries to add the crc to
buf[] the fortify-panic handler gets triggered:

[   80.842193] memcpy: detected buffer overflow: 4 byte write of buffer size 0
[   80.842243] WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 272 at lib/string_helpers.c:1032 __fortify_report+0x45/0x50
...
[   80.843175]  __fortify_panic+0x9/0xb
[   80.843186]  vsc_tp_xfer.cold+0x67/0x67 [mei_vsc_hw]
[   80.843210]  ? seqcount_lockdep_reader_access.constprop.0+0x82/0x90
[   80.843229]  ? lockdep_hardirqs_on+0x7c/0x110
[   80.843250]  mei_vsc_hw_start+0x98/0x120 [mei_vsc]
[   80.843270]  mei_reset+0x11d/0x420 [mei]

The easiest fix would be to just drop the counted-by but with the exception
of the ack buffer in vsc_tp_xfer_helper() which only contains enough room
for the packet-header, all other uses of vsc_tp_packet always use a buffer
of VSC_TP_MAX_XFER_SIZE bytes for the packet.

Instead of just dropping the counted-by, split the vsc_tp_packet struct
definition into a header and a full-packet definition and use a fixed
size buf[] in the packet definition, this way fortify-source buffer
overrun checking still works when enabled.

Thus, goto 'err' label and free 'mdev' again causes a double free.
Just return if mcb_device_register() fails.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37811
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 8, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: chipidea: ci_hdrc_imx: fix usbmisc handling

usbmisc is an optional device property so it is totally valid for the
corresponding data->usbmisc_data to have a NULL value.

Check that before dereferencing the pointer.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37812
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 8, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: cdns3: Fix deadlock when using NCM gadget

The cdns3 driver has the same NCM deadlock as fixed in cdnsp by commit
58f2fcb3a845 ("usb: cdnsp: Fix deadlock issue during using NCM gadget").

Under PREEMPT_RT the deadlock can be readily triggered by heavy network
traffic, for example using "iperf --bidir" over NCM ethernet link.

The deadlock occurs because the threaded interrupt handler gets
preempted by a softirq, but both are protected by the same spinlock.
Prevent deadlock by disabling softirq during threaded irq handler.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37813
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 8, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: xhci: Fix invalid pointer dereference in Etron workaround

This check is performed before prepare_transfer() and prepare_ring(), so
enqueue can already point at the final link TRB of a segment. And indeed
it will, some 0.4% of times this code is called.

Then enqueue + 1 is an invalid pointer. It will crash the kernel right
away or load some junk which may look like a link TRB and cause the real
link TRB to be replaced with a NOOP. This wouldn't end well.

Use a functionally equivalent test which doesn't dereference the pointer
and always gives correct result.

Something has crashed my machine twice in recent days while playing with
an Etron HC, and a control transfer stress test ran for confirmation has
just crashed it again. The same test passes with this patch applied.

      <title>CVE-2025-37814 - Linux Kernel TTY Mouse Reporting Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37814
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 8, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: Require CAP_SYS_ADMIN for all usages of TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT

This requirement was overeagerly loosened in commit 2f83e38a095f
("tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes without CAP_SYS_ADMIN"), but as
it turns out,

  (1) the logic I implemented there was inconsistent (apologies!),

  (2) TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT might actually be a small security risk
      after all, and

  (3) TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is only meant to be used by the mouse
      daemon (GPM or Consolation), which runs as CAP_SYS_ADMIN
      already.

In more detail:

1. The previous patch has inconsistent logic:

   In commit 2f83e38a095f ("tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes
   without CAP_SYS_ADMIN"), we checked for sel_mode ==
   TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, but overlooked that the lower four bits of
   this "mode" parameter were actually used as an additional way to
   pass an argument.  So the patch did actually still require
   CAP_SYS_ADMIN, if any of the mouse button bits are set, but did not
   require it if none of the mouse buttons bits are set.

   This logic is inconsistent and was not intentional.  We should have
   the same policies for using TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT independent of the
   value of the "hidden" mouse button argument.

   I sent a separate documentation patch to the man page list with
   more details on TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT:
   https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250223091342.35523-2-gnoack3000@gmail.com/

2. TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is indeed a potential security risk which can
   let an attacker simulate "keyboard" input to command line
   applications on the same terminal, like TIOCSTI and some other
   TIOCLINUX "selection mode" IOCTLs.

   By enabling mouse reporting on a terminal and then injecting mouse
   reports through TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, an attacker can simulate
   mouse movements on the same terminal, similar to the TIOCSTI
   keystroke injection attacks that were previously possible with
   TIOCSTI and other TIOCL_SETSEL selection modes.

   Many programs (including libreadline/bash) are then prone to
   misinterpret these mouse reports as normal keyboard input because
   they do not expect input in the X11 mouse protocol form.  The
   attacker does not have complete control over the escape sequence,
   but they can at least control the values of two consecutive bytes
   in the binary mouse reporting escape sequence.

   I went into more detail on that in the discussion at
   https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250221.0a947528d8f3@gnoack.org/

   It is not equally trivial to simulate arbitrary keystrokes as it
   was with TIOCSTI (commit 83efeeeb3d04 ("tty: Allow TIOCSTI to be
   disabled")), but the general mechanism is there, and together with
   the small number of existing legit use cases (see below), it would
   be better to revert back to requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN for
   TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, as it was already the case before
   commit 2f83e38a095f ("tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes without
   CAP_SYS_ADMIN").

3. TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is only used by the mouse daemons (GPM or
   Consolation), and they are the only legit use case:

   To quote console_codes(4):

     The mouse tracking facility is intended to return
     xterm(1)-compatible mouse status reports.  Because the console
     driver has no way to know the device or type of the mouse, these
     reports are returned in the console input stream only when the
     virtual terminal driver receives a mouse update ioctl.  These
     ioctls must be generated by a mouse-aware user-mode application
     such as the gpm(8) daemon.

   Jared Finder has also confirmed in
   https://lore.kernel.org/all/491f3df9de6593df8e70dbe77614b026@finder.org/
   that Emacs does not call TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT directly, and it
   would be difficult to find good reasons for doing that, given that
   it would interfere with the reports that GPM is sending.

      <title>CVE-2025-32441 - Rack Session Pool Session Hijacking Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32441
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 7, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to version 2.2.14, when using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, simultaneous rack requests can restore a deleted rack session, which allows the unauthenticated user to occupy that session. Rack session middleware prepares the session at the beginning of request, then saves is back to the store with possible changes applied by host rack application. This way the session becomes to be a subject of race conditions in general sense over concurrent rack requests. When using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, and provided the attacker can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue), the session may be restored if the attacker can trigger a long running request (within that same session) adjacent to the user logging out, in order to retain illicit access even after a user has attempted to logout. Version 2.2.14 contains a patch for the issue. Some other mitigations are available. Either ensure the application invalidates sessions atomically by marking them as logged out e.g., using a `logged_out` flag, instead of deleting them, and check this flag on every request to prevent reuse; or implement a custom session store that tracks session invalidation timestamps and refuses to accept session data if the session was invalidated after the request began.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-35939
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 7, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Craft CMS stores arbitrary content provided by unauthenticated users in session files. This content could be accessed and executed, possibly using an independent vulnerability. Craft CMS redirects requests that require authentication to the login page and generates a session file on the server at `/var/lib/php/sessions`. Such session files are named `sess_[session_value]`, where `[session_value]` is provided to the client in a `Set-Cookie` response header. Craft CMS stores the return URL requested by the client without sanitizing parameters. Consequently, an unauthenticated client can introduce arbitrary values, such as PHP code, to a known local file location on the server. Craft CMS versions 5.7.5 and 4.15.3 have been released to address this issue.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46727
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 7, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14, `Rack::QueryParser` parses query strings and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies into Ruby data structures without imposing any limit on the number of parameters, allowing attackers to send requests with extremely large numbers of parameters. The vulnerability arises because `Rack::QueryParser` iterates over each `&`-separated key-value pair and adds it to a Hash without enforcing an upper bound on the total number of parameters. This allows an attacker to send a single request containing hundreds of thousands (or more) of parameters, which consumes excessive memory and CPU during parsing. An attacker can trigger denial of service by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests, which can cause memory exhaustion or pin CPU resources, stalling or crashing the Rack server. This results in full service disruption until the affected worker is restarted. Versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14 fix the issue. Some other mitigations are available. One may use middleware to enforce a maximum query string size or parameter count, or employ a reverse proxy (such as Nginx) to limit request sizes and reject oversized query strings or bodies. Limiting request body sizes and query string lengths at the web server or CDN level is an effective mitigation.

      <title>CVE-2025-46821 - Envoy URI Template Path Matching Bypass Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46821
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 7, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 7 hours, 41 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Envoy is a cloud-native edge/middle/service proxy. Prior to versions 1.34.1, 1.33.3, 1.32.6, and 1.31.8, Envoy's URI template matcher incorrectly excludes the `*` character from a set of valid characters in the URI path. As a result URI path containing the `*` character will not match a URI template expressions. This can result in bypass of RBAC rules when configured using the `uri_template` permissions. This vulnerability is fixed in Envoy versions v1.34.1, v1.33.3, v1.32.6, v1.31.8. As a workaround, configure additional RBAC permissions using `url_path` with `safe_regex` expression.

      <title>CVE-2025-30147 - Hyperledger Besu EC Point Crafting Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30147
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 7, 2025, 7:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 37 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Besu Native contains scripts and tooling that is used to build and package the native libraries used by the Ethereum client Hyperledger Besu. Besu 24.7.1 through 25.2.2, corresponding to besu-native versions 0.9.0 through 1.2.1, have a potential consensus bug for the precompiles ALTBN128_ADD (0x06), ALTBN128_MUL (0x07), and ALTBN128_PAIRING (0x08). These precompiles were reimplemented in besu-native using gnark-crypto's bn254 implementation, as the former implementation used a library which was no longer maintained and not sufficiently performant. The new gnark implementation was initially added in version 0.9.0 of besu-native but was not utilized by Besu until version 0.9.2 in Besu 24.7.1. The issue is that there are EC points which may be crafted which are in the correct subgroup but are not on the curve and the besu-native gnark implementation was relying on subgroup checks to perform point-on-curve checks as well. The version of gnark-crypto used at the time did not do this check when performing subgroup checks. The result is that it was possible for Besu to give an incorrect result and fall out of consensus when executing one of these precompiles against a specially crafted input point. Additionally, homogenous Besu-only networks can potentially enshrine invalid state which would be incorrect and difficult to process with patched versions of besu which handle these calls correctly. The underlying defect has been patched in besu-native release 1.3.0. The fixed version of Besu is version 25.3.0. As a workaround for versions of Besu with the problem, the native precompile for altbn128 may be disabled in favor of the pure-java implementation. The pure java implementation is significantly slower, but does not have this consensus issue.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-20214
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 7, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in the Network Configuration Access Control Module (NACM) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain unauthorized read access to configuration or operational data.

 This vulnerability exists because a subtle change in inner API call behavior causes results to be filtered incorrectly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using either NETCONF, RESTCONF, or gRPC Network Management Interface (gNMI) protocols and query data on paths that may have been denied by the NACM configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access data that should have been restricted according to the NACM configuration.

 Note: This vulnerability requires that the attacker obtain the credentials from a valid user with privileges lower than 15, and that NACM was configured to provide restricted read access for that user.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46551
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 7, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 39 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>JRuby-OpenSSL is an add-on gem for JRuby that emulates the Ruby OpenSSL native library. Starting in JRuby-OpenSSL version 0.12.1 and prior to version 0.15.4 (corresponding to JRuby versions starting in 9.3.4.0 prior to 9.4.12.1 and 10.0.0.0 prior to 10.0.0.1), when verifying SSL certificates, JRuby-OpenSSL does not verify that the hostname presented in the certificate matches the one the user tries to connect to. This means a man-in-the-middle could just present any valid cert for a completely different domain they own, and JRuby would accept the cert. Anybody using JRuby to make requests of external APIs, or scraping the web, that depends on https to connect securely. JRuby-OpenSSL version 0.15.4 contains a fix for the issue. This fix is included in JRuby versions 10.0.0.1 and 9.4.12.1.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 7, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 40 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Prior to versions 6.0.14, 6.1.10, and 6.2.0, it is possible to obtain user session cookies by submitting an HTML form as part of an Event Definition Remediation Step field. For this attack to succeed, the attacker needs a user account with permissions to create event definitions, while the user must have permissions to view alerts. Additionally, an active Input must be present on the Graylog server that is capable of receiving form data (e.g. a HTTP input, TCP raw or syslog etc). Versions 6.0.14, 6.1.10, and 6.2.0 fix the issue. No known workarounds are available, as long as the relatively rare prerequisites are met.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2020-36791

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: keep alloc_hash updated after hash allocation

In commit 599be01ee567 ("net_sched: fix an OOB access in cls_tcindex")
I moved cp->hash calculation before the first
tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash(), but cp->alloc_hash is left untouched.
This difference could lead to another out of bound access.

cp->alloc_hash should always be the size allocated, we should
update it after this tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash().

<strong>Published : </strong> May 7, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 38 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Memory Allocation with Excessive Size Value vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ.

During unmarshalling of OpenWire commands the size value of buffers was not properly validated which could lead to excessive memory allocation and be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) by depleting process memory, thereby affecting applications and services that rely on the availability of the ActiveMQ broker when not using mutual TLS connections.
This issue affects Apache ActiveMQ: from 6.0.0 before 6.1.6, from 5.18.0 before 5.18.7, from 5.17.0 before 5.17.7, before 5.16.8. ActiveMQ 5.19.0 is not affected.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 6.1.6+, 5.19.0+,  5.18.7+, 5.17.7, or 5.16.8 or which fixes the issue.

Existing users may implement mutual TLS to mitigate the risk on affected brokers.

      <title>CVE-2024-12225 - Quarkus WebAuthn Default Endpoints Information Disclosure and Authentication Bypass</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-12225
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 6, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability was found in Quarkus in the quarkus-security-webauthn module. The Quarkus WebAuthn module publishes default REST endpoints for registering and logging users in while allowing developers to provide custom REST endpoints. When developers provide custom REST endpoints, the default endpoints remain accessible, potentially allowing attackers to obtain a login cookie that has no corresponding user in the Quarkus application or, depending on how the application is written, could correspond to an existing user that has no relation with the current attacker, allowing anyone to log in as an existing user by just knowing that user's user name.

      <title>CVE-2025-46820 - GitHub phpgt/Dom GitHub Token Disclosure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46820
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 6, 2025, 7:16 p.m. | 7 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>phpgt/Dom provides access to modern DOM APIs. Versions of phpgt/Dom prior to 4.1.8 expose the GITHUB_TOKEN in the Dom workflow run artifact. The ci.yml workflow file uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the build artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated .git/config file containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the GitHub API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in your repository. Any downstream user of the repository may be affected, but the token should only be valid for the duration of the workflow run, limiting the time during which exploitation could occur. Version 4.1.8 fixes the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-46815 - ZITADEL IdP Intent Session Token Abuse</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46815
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 6, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 8 hours, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The identity infrastructure software ZITADEL offers developers the ability to manage user sessions using the Session API. This API enables the use of IdPs for authentication, known as idp intents. Following a successful idp intent, the client receives an id and token on a predefined URI. These id and token can then be used to authenticate the user or their session. However, prior to versions 3.0.0, 2.71.9, and 2.70.10, it was possible to exploit this feature by repeatedly using intents. This allowed an attacker with access to the application’s URI to retrieve the id and token, enabling them to authenticate on behalf of the user. It's important to note that the use of additional factors (MFA) prevents a complete authentication process and, consequently, access to the ZITADEL API. Versions 3.0.0, 2.71.9, and 2.70.10 contain a fix for the issue. No known workarounds other than upgrading are available.

      <title>CVE-2025-30165 - vLLM ZeroMQ Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30165
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 6, 2025, 5:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models. In a multi-node vLLM deployment using the V0 engine, vLLM uses ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes. The secondary vLLM hosts open a `SUB` ZeroMQ socket and connect to an `XPUB` socket on the primary vLLM host. When data is received on this `SUB` socket, it is deserialized with `pickle`. This is unsafe, as it can be abused to execute code on a remote machine. Since the vulnerability exists in a client that connects to the primary vLLM host, this vulnerability serves as an escalation point. If the primary vLLM host is compromised, this vulnerability could be used to compromise the rest of the hosts in the vLLM deployment. Attackers could also use other means to exploit the vulnerability without requiring access to the primary vLLM host. One example would be the use of ARP cache poisoning to redirect traffic to a malicious endpoint used to deliver a payload with arbitrary code to execute on the target machine. Note that this issue only affects the V0 engine, which has been off by default since v0.8.0. Further, the issue only applies to a deployment using tensor parallelism across multiple hosts, which we do not expect to be a common deployment pattern. Since V0 is has been off by default since v0.8.0 and the fix is fairly invasive, the maintainers of vLLM have decided not to fix this issue. Instead, the maintainers recommend that users ensure their environment is on a secure network in case this pattern is in use. The V1 engine is not affected by this issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-32022 - Finit Urandom Heap Buffer Overwrite Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32022
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 6, 2025, 5:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Finit provides fast init for Linux systems. Finit's urandom plugin has a heap buffer overwrite vulnerability at boot which leads to it overwriting other parts of the heap, possibly causing random instabilities and undefined behavior. The urandom plugin is enabled by default, so this bug affects everyone using Finit 4.2 or later that do not explicitly disable the plugin at build time. This bug is fixed in Finit 4.12. Those who cannot upgrade or backport the fix to urandom.c are strongly recommended to disable the plugin in the call to the `configure` script.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46814
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 6, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 35 minutes ago

      <title>CVE-2025-46762 - Apache Parquet Parquet-avro Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46762
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 6, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 20 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Schema parsing in the parquet-avro module of Apache Parquet 1.15.0 and previous versions allows bad actors to execute arbitrary code.

While 1.15.1 introduced a fix to restrict untrusted packages, the default setting of trusted packages still allows malicious classes from these packages to be executed.

The exploit is only applicable if the client code of parquet-avro uses the "specific" or the "reflect" models deliberately for reading Parquet files. ("generic" model is not impacted)

Users are recommended to upgrade to 1.15.2 or set the system property "org.apache.parquet.avro.SERIALIZABLE_PACKAGES" to an empty string on 1.15.1. Both are sufficient to fix the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-3609 - Reales WP STPT Unauthorized User Registration Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3609
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 6, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 34 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Reales WP STPT plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized user registration in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This is due to the 'reales_user_signup_form' AJAX action not verifying if user registration is enabled, prior to registering a user. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new user accounts, which can be leveraged with CVE-XX to achieve privilege escalation.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3610
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 6, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 34 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Reales WP STPT plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like password. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's passwords and email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account. This can be combined with CVE-2025-3609 to achieve remote code execution as an originally unauthenticated user with no account.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46728
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 6, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 33 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>cpp-httplib is a C++ header-only HTTP/HTTPS server and client library. Prior to version 0.20.1, the library fails to enforce configured size limits on incoming request bodies when `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is used or when no `Content-Length` header is provided. A remote attacker can send a chunked request without the terminating zero-length chunk, causing uncontrolled memory allocation on the server. This leads to potential exhaustion of system memory and results in a server crash or unresponsiveness. Version 0.20.1 fixes the issue by enforcing limits during parsing. If the limit is exceeded at any point during reading, the connection is terminated immediately. A short-term workaround through a Reverse Proxy is available. If updating the library immediately is not feasible, deploy a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) in front of the `cpp-httplib` application. Configure the proxy to enforce maximum request body size limits, thereby stopping excessively large requests before they reach the vulnerable library code.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46734
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 5, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 33 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>league/commonmark is a PHP Markdown parser. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Attributes extension of the league/commonmark library (versions 1.5.0 through 2.6.x) allows remote attackers to insert malicious JavaScript calls into HTML. The league/commonmark library provides configuration options such as `html_input: 'strip'` and `allow_unsafe_links: false` to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by stripping raw HTML and disallowing unsafe links. However, when the Attributes Extension is enabled, it introduces a way for users to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into elements via Markdown syntax using curly braces. Version 2.7.0 contains three changes to prevent this XSS attack vector: All attributes starting with `on` are considered unsafe and blocked by default; support for an explicit allowlist of allowed HTML attributes; and manually-added `href` and `src` attributes now respect the existing `allow_unsafe_links` configuration option. If upgrading is not feasible, please consider disabling the `AttributesExtension` for untrusted users and/or filtering the rendered HTML through a library like HTMLPurifier.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46813
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 5, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 33 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Discourse is an open-source community platform. A data leak vulnerability affects sites deployed between commits 10df7fdee060d44accdee7679d66d778d1136510 and 82d84af6b0efbd9fa2aeec3e91ce7be1a768511b. On login-required sites, the leak meant that some content on the site's homepage could be visible to unauthenticated users. Only login-required sites that got deployed during this timeframe are affected, roughly between April 30 2025 noon EDT and May 2 2025, noon EDT. Sites on the stable branch are unaffected. Private content on an instance's homepage could be visible to unauthenticated users on login-required sites. Versions of 3.5.0.beta4 after commit 82d84af6b0efbd9fa2aeec3e91ce7be1a768511b are not vulnerable to the issue. No workarounds are available. Sites must upgrade to a non-vulnerable version of Discourse.

      <title>CVE-2025-46730 - "MobSF ZIP Bomb Denial of Service Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46730
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 5, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 36 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>MobSF is a mobile application security testing tool used. Typically, MobSF is deployed on centralized internal or cloud-based servers that also host other security tools and web applications. Access to the MobSF web interface is often granted to internal security teams, audit teams, and external vendors.  MobSF provides a feature that allows users to upload ZIP files for static analysis. Upon upload, these ZIP files are automatically extracted and stored within the MobSF directory. However, in versions up to and including 4.3.2, this functionality lacks a check on the total uncompressed size of the ZIP file, making it vulnerable to a ZIP of Death (zip bomb) attack. Due to the absence of safeguards against oversized extractions, an attacker can craft a specially prepared ZIP file that is small in compressed form but expands to a massive size upon extraction. Exploiting this, an attacker can exhaust the server's disk space, leading to a complete denial of service (DoS) not just for MobSF, but also for any other applications or websites hosted on the same server. This vulnerability can lead to complete server disruption in an organization which can affect other internal portals and tools too (which are hosted on the same server). If some organization has created their customized cloud based mobile security tool using MobSF core then an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crash their servers. Commit 6987a946485a795f4fd38cebdb4860b368a1995d fixes this issue. As an additional mitigation, it is recommended to implement a safeguard that checks the total uncompressed size of any uploaded ZIP file before extraction. If the estimated uncompressed size exceeds a safe threshold (e.g., 100 MB), MobSF should reject the file and notify the user.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-1909
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 5, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 32 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The BuddyBoss Platform Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.7.01.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46340
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 5, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 18 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.0.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, due to an oversight in the validation performed in `UrlPreviewService` and `MkUrlPreview`, it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS into the `MkUrlPreview` component. `UrlPreviewService.wrap` falls back to returning the original URL if it's using a protocol that is likely to not be understood by Misskey, IE something other than `http` or `https`. This both can de-anonymize users and_allow further attacks in the client. Additionally, `MkUrlPreview` doesn't escape CSS when applying a `background-image` property, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that applies arbitrary styles to the preview element. Theoretically, an attacker can craft a CSS injection payload to create a fake error message that can deceive the user into giving away their credentials or similar sensitive information. Version 2025.4.1 contains a patch for the issue.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>@misskey-dev/summaly is a tool for getting a summary of a web page. Starting in version 3.0.1 and prior to version 5.2.1, a logic error in the main `summaly` function causes the `allowRedirects` option to never be passed to any plugins, and as a result, isn't enforced. Misskey will follow redirects, despite explicitly requesting not to. Version 5.2.1 contains a patch for the issue.

<strong>Description : </strong>Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Starting in version 12.31.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, missing validation in `Mk:api` allows malicious AiScript code to access additional endpoints that it isn't designed to have access to. The missing validation allows malicious AiScript code to prefix a URL with `../` to step out of the `/api` directory, thereby being able to make requests to other endpoints, such as `/files`, `/url`, and `/proxy`. Version 2025.4.1 fixes the issue.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46571
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 5, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 18 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely offline. Prior to version 0.6.6, low privileged users can upload HTML files which contain JavaScript code via the `/api/v1/files/` backend endpoint. This endpoint returns a file id, which can be used to open the file in the browser and trigger the JavaScript code in the user's browser. Under the default settings, files uploaded by low-privileged users can only be viewed by admins or themselves, limiting the impact of this vulnerability. A link to such a file can be sent to an admin, and if clicked, will give the low-privileged user complete control over the admin's account, ultimately enabling RCE via functions. Version 0.6.6 contains a fix for the issue.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46719
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 5, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 18 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Open WebUI is a self-hosted artificial intelligence platform designed to operate entirely offline. Prior to version 0.6.6, a vulnerability in the way certain html tags in chat messages are rendered allows attackers to inject JavaScript code into a chat transcript. The JavaScript code will be executed in the user's browser every time that chat transcript is opened, allowing attackers to retrieve the user's access token and gain full control over their account. Chat transcripts can be shared with other users in the same server, or with the whole open-webui community if "Enable Community Sharing" is enabled in the admin panel. If this exploit is used against an admin user, it is possible to achieve Remote Code Execution on the server where the open-webui backend is hosted. This can be done by creating a new function which contains malicious python code. This vulnerability also affects chat transcripts uploaded to `https://openwebui.com/c/<user>/<chat_id>`, allowing for wormable stored XSS in https[:]//openwebui[.]com. Version 0.6.6 contains a patch for the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-46720 - Keystone Node.js Oracle Filter Bypass</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46720
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 5, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 18 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Keystone is a content management system for Node.js. Prior to version 6.5.0, `{field}.isFilterable` access control can be bypassed in `update` and `delete` mutations by adding additional unique filters. These filters can be used as an oracle to probe the existence or value of otherwise unreadable fields. Specifically, when a mutation includes a `where` clause with multiple unique filters (e.g. `id` and `email`), Keystone will attempt to match records even if filtering by the latter fields would normally be rejected by `field.isFilterable` or `list.defaultIsFilterable`. This can allow malicious actors to infer the presence of a particular field value when a filter is successful in returning a result. This affects any project relying on the default or dynamic `isFilterable` behavior (at the list or field level) to prevent external users from using the filtering of fields as a discovery mechanism. While this access control is respected during `findMany` operations, it was not completely enforced during `update` and `delete` mutations when accepting more than one unique `where` values in filters. This has no impact on projects using `isFilterable: false` or `defaultIsFilterable: false` for sensitive fields, or for those who have otherwise omitted filtering by these fields from their GraphQL schema. This issue has been patched in `@keystone-6/core` version 6.5.0. To mitigate this issue in older versions where patching is not a viable pathway, set `isFilterable: false` statically for relevant fields to prevent filtering by them earlier in the access control pipeline (that is, don't use functions); set `{field}.graphql.omit.read: true` for relevant fields, which implicitly removes filtering by these fields from the GraphQL schema; and/or deny `update` and `delete` operations for the relevant lists completely.

      <title>CVE-2024-58098 - Linux Kernel BPF Packet Pointer Invalidation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-58098
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 5, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 1 minute ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: track changes_pkt_data property for global functions

When processing calls to certain helpers, verifier invalidates all
packet pointers in a current state. For example, consider the
following program:

    __attribute__((__noinline__))
    long skb_pull_data(struct __sk_buff *sk, __u32 len)
    {
        return bpf_skb_pull_data(sk, len);
    }

    SEC("tc")
    int test_invalidate_checks(struct __sk_buff *sk)
    {
        int *p = (void *)(long)sk->data;
        if ((void *)(p + 1) > (void *)(long)sk->data_end) return TCX_DROP;
        skb_pull_data(sk, 0);
        *p = 42;
        return TCX_PASS;
    }

After a call to bpf_skb_pull_data() the pointer 'p' can't be used
safely. See function filter.c:bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() for a list
of such helpers.

At the moment verifier invalidates packet pointers when processing
helper function calls, and does not traverse global sub-programs when
processing calls to global sub-programs. This means that calls to
helpers done from global sub-programs do not invalidate pointers in
the caller state. E.g. the program above is unsafe, but is not
rejected by verifier.

This commit fixes the omission by computing field
bpf_subprog_info->changes_pkt_data for each sub-program before main
verification pass.
changes_pkt_data should be set if:
- subprogram calls helper for which bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data
  returns true;
- subprogram calls a global function,
  for which bpf_subprog_info->changes_pkt_data should be set.

The verifier.c:check_cfg() pass is modified to compute this
information. The commit relies on depth first instruction traversal
done by check_cfg() and absence of recursive function calls:
- check_cfg() would eventually visit every call to subprogram S in a
  state when S is fully explored;
- when S is fully explored:
  - every direct helper call within S is explored
    (and thus changes_pkt_data is set if needed);
  - every call to subprogram S1 called by S was visited with S1 fully
    explored (and thus S inherits changes_pkt_data from S1).

The downside of such approach is that dead code elimination is not
taken into account: if a helper call inside global function is dead
because of current configuration, verifier would conservatively assume
that the call occurs for the purpose of the changes_pkt_data
computation.

      <title>CVE-2024-58100 - Linux Kernel bpf Changes_pkt_data Property Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-58100
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 5, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 1 minute ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: check changes_pkt_data property for extension programs

When processing calls to global sub-programs, verifier decides whether
to invalidate all packet pointers in current state depending on the
changes_pkt_data property of the global sub-program.

Because of this, an extension program replacing a global sub-program
must be compatible with changes_pkt_data property of the sub-program
being replaced.

This commit:
- adds changes_pkt_data flag to struct bpf_prog_aux:
  - this flag is set in check_cfg() for main sub-program;
  - in jit_subprogs() for other sub-programs;
- modifies bpf_check_attach_btf_id() to check changes_pkt_data flag;
- moves call to check_attach_btf_id() after the call to check_cfg(),
  because it needs changes_pkt_data flag to be set:

    bpf_check:
      ...                             ...
    - check_attach_btf_id             resolve_pseudo_ldimm64
      resolve_pseudo_ldimm64   -->    bpf_prog_is_offloaded
      bpf_prog_is_offloaded           check_cfg
      check_cfg                     + check_attach_btf_id
      ...                             ...

The following fields are set by check_attach_btf_id():
- env->ops
- prog->aux->attach_btf_trace
- prog->aux->attach_func_name
- prog->aux->attach_func_proto
- prog->aux->dst_trampoline
- prog->aux->mod
- prog->aux->saved_dst_attach_type
- prog->aux->saved_dst_prog_type
- prog->expected_attach_type

Neither of these fields are used by resolve_pseudo_ldimm64() or
bpf_prog_offload_verifier_prep() (for netronome and netdevsim
drivers), so the reordering is safe.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-58237
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 5, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 1 minute ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: consider that tail calls invalidate packet pointers

Tail-called programs could execute any of the helpers that invalidate
packet pointers. Hence, conservatively assume that each tail call
invalidates packet pointers.

Making the change in bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() automatically makes
use of check_cfg() logic that computes 'changes_pkt_data' effect for
global sub-programs, such that the following program could be
rejected:

    int tail_call(struct __sk_buff *sk)
    {
    	bpf_tail_call_static(sk, &jmp_table, 0);
    	return 0;
    }

    SEC("tc")
    int not_safe(struct __sk_buff *sk)
    {
    	int *p = (void *)(long)sk->data;
    	... make p valid ...
    	tail_call(sk);
    	*p = 42; /* this is unsafe */
    	...
    }

The tc_bpf2bpf.c:subprog_tc() needs change: mark it as a function that
can invalidate packet pointers. Otherwise, it can't be freplaced with
tailcall_freplace.c:entry_freplace() that does a tail call.

      <title>CVE-2025-2905 - WSO2 API Manager XXE File Disclosure and Denial of Service Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-2905
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 5, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 7 hours, 2 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability exists in the gateway component of WSO2 API Manager due to insufficient validation of XML input in crafted URL paths. User-supplied XML is parsed without appropriate restrictions, enabling external entity resolution.


This vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker to read files from the server’s filesystem or perform denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.



  *  
On systems running JDK 7 or early JDK 8, full file contents may be exposed.




  *  
On later versions of JDK 8 and newer, only the first line of a file may be read, due to improvements in XML parser behavior.




  *  
DoS attacks such as "Billion Laughs" payloads can cause service disruption.

      <title>CVE-2025-37799 - vmxnet3 Linux Kernel Malformed Packet Sizing Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37799
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 3, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 1 day, 12 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vmxnet3: Fix malformed packet sizing in vmxnet3_process_xdp

vmxnet3 driver's XDP handling is buggy for packet sizes using ring0 (that
is, packet sizes between 128 - 3k bytes).

We noticed MTU-related connectivity issues with Cilium's service load-
balancing in case of vmxnet3 as NIC underneath. A simple curl to a HTTP
backend service where the XDP LB was doing IPIP encap led to overly large
packet sizes but only for *some* of the packets (e.g. HTTP GET request)
while others (e.g. the prior TCP 3WHS) looked completely fine on the wire.

In fact, the pcap recording on the backend node actually revealed that the
node with the XDP LB was leaking uninitialized kernel data onto the wire
for the affected packets, for example, while the packets should have been
152 bytes their actual size was 1482 bytes, so the remainder after 152 bytes
was padded with whatever other data was in that page at the time (e.g. we
saw user/payload data from prior processed packets).

We only noticed this through an MTU issue, e.g. when the XDP LB node and
the backend node both had the same MTU (e.g. 1500) then the curl request
got dropped on the backend node's NIC given the packet was too large even
though the IPIP-encapped packet normally would never even come close to
the MTU limit. Lowering the MTU on the XDP LB (e.g. 1480) allowed to let
the curl request succeed (which also indicates that the kernel ignored the
padding, and thus the issue wasn't very user-visible).

Commit e127ce7699c1 ("vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom") was too eager
to also switch xdp_prepare_buff() from rcd->len to rbi->len. It really needs
to stick to rcd->len which is the actual packet length from the descriptor.
The latter we also feed into vmxnet3_process_xdp_small(), by the way, and
it indicates the correct length needed to initialize the xdp->{data,data_end}
parts. For e127ce7699c1 ("vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom") the
relevant part was adapting xdp_init_buff() to address the warning given the
xdp_data_hard_end() depends on xdp->frame_sz. With that fixed, traffic on
the wire looks good again.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-58135
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 3, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 1 day, 9 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Mojolicious versions from 7.28 through 9.39 for Perl may generate weak HMAC session secrets.

When creating a default app with the "mojo generate app" tool, a weak secret is written to the application's configuration file using the insecure rand() function, and used for authenticating and protecting the integrity of the application's sessions. This may allow an attacker to brute force the application's session keys.

      <title>CVE-2025-3918 - WordPress Job Listings Privilege Escalation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3918
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 3, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 15 hours, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Job Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation due to improper authorization within the register_action() function in versions 0.1 to 0.1.1. The plugin’s registration handler reads the client-supplied $_POST['user_role'] and passes it directly to wp_insert_user() without restricting to a safe set of roles.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator.

      <title>CVE-2025-46723 - OpenVM AUIPC Instruction Overflow Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46723
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 2, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 19 hours, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>OpenVM is a performant and modular zkVM framework built for customization and extensibility. In version 1.0.0, OpenVM is vulnerable to overflow through byte decomposition of pc in AUIPC chip. A typo results in the highest limb of pc being range checked to 8-bits instead of 6-bits. This results in the if statement never being triggered because the enumeration gives i=0,1,2, when instead the enumeration should give i=1,2,3, leaving pc_limbs[3] range checked to 8-bits instead of 6-bits. This leads to a vulnerability where the pc_limbs decomposition differs from the true pc, which means a malicious prover can make the destination register take a different value than the AUIPC instruction dictates, by making the decomposition overflow the BabyBear field. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.0.

      <title>CVE-2023-53136 - Linux af_unix Struct PID Leak Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2023-53136
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 2, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 34 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: fix struct pid leaks in OOB support

syzbot reported struct pid leak [1].

Issue is that queue_oob() calls maybe_add_creds() which potentially
holds a reference on a pid.

But skb->destructor is not set (either directly or by calling
unix_scm_to_skb())

This means that subsequent kfree_skb() or consume_skb() would leak
this reference.

In this fix, I chose to fully support scm even for the OOB message.

      <title>CVE-2023-53137 - Linux Kernel Ext4 Directory Corruption Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2023-53137
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 2, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 34 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: Fix possible corruption when moving a directory

When we are renaming a directory to a different directory, we need to
update '..' entry in the moved directory. However nothing prevents moved
directory from being modified and even converted from the inline format
to the normal format. When such race happens the rename code gets
confused and we crash. Fix the problem by locking the moved directory.

When unregistering a net device, unregister_netdevice_many_notify()
sets the device's reg_state to NETREG_UNREGISTERING, calls notifiers
with NETDEV_UNREGISTER, and adds the device to the todo list.

Later on, devices in the todo list are processed by netdev_run_todo().
netdev_run_todo() waits devices' reference count become 1 while
rebdoadcasting NETDEV_UNREGISTER notification.

When cfusbl_device_notify() is called with NETDEV_UNREGISTER multiple
times, the parent device might be freed.  This could cause UAF.
Processing NETDEV_UNREGISTER multiple times also causes inbalance of
reference count for the module.

This patch fixes the issue by accepting only first NETDEV_UNREGISTER
notification.

      <title>CVE-2023-53142 - "Ice: Buffer Overflow in ice_get_module_eeprom()"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2023-53142
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 2, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 34 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: copy last block omitted in ice_get_module_eeprom()

ice_get_module_eeprom() is broken since commit e9c9692c8a81 ("ice:
Reimplement module reads used by ethtool") In this refactor,
ice_get_module_eeprom() reads the eeprom in blocks of size 8.
But the condition that should protect the buffer overflow
ignores the last block. The last block always contains zeros.

Bug uncovered by ethtool upstream commit 9538f384b535
("netlink: eeprom: Defer page requests to individual parsers")
After this commit, ethtool reads a block with length = 1;
to read the SFF-8024 identifier value.

      <title>CVE-2023-53143 - "Ext4 Linux Kernel Off-by-One Error in fsmap Handling"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2023-53143
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 2, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 34 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix another off-by-one fsmap error on 1k block filesystems

Apparently syzbot figured out that issuing this FSMAP call:

struct fsmap_head cmd = {
	.fmh_count	= ...;
	.fmh_keys	= {
		{ .fmr_device = /* ext4 dev */, .fmr_physical = 0, },
		{ .fmr_device = /* ext4 dev */, .fmr_physical = 0, },
	},
...
};
ret = ioctl(fd, FS_IOC_GETFSMAP, &cmd);

Produces this crash if the underlying filesystem is a 1k-block ext4
filesystem:

For GETFSMAP calls, the caller selects a physical block device by
writing its block number into fsmap_head.fmh_keys[01].fmr_device.
To query mappings for a subrange of the device, the starting byte of the
range is written to fsmap_head.fmh_keys[0].fmr_physical and the last
byte of the range goes in fsmap_head.fmh_keys[1].fmr_physical.

IOWs, to query what mappings overlap with bytes 3-14 of /dev/sda, you'd
set the inputs as follows:

	fmh_keys[0] = { .fmr_device = major(8, 0), .fmr_physical = 3},
	fmh_keys[1] = { .fmr_device = major(8, 0), .fmr_physical = 14},

Which would return you whatever is mapped in the 12 bytes starting at
physical offset 3.

The crash is due to insufficient range validation of keys[1] in
ext4_getfsmap_datadev.  On 1k-block filesystems, block 0 is not part of
the filesystem, which means that s_first_data_block is nonzero.
ext4_get_group_no_and_offset subtracts this quantity from the blocknr
argument before cracking it into a group number and a block number
within a group.  IOWs, block group 0 spans blocks 1-8192 (1-based)
instead of 0-8191 (0-based) like what happens with larger blocksizes.

The net result of this encoding is that blocknr < s_first_data_block is
not a valid input to this function.  The end_fsb variable is set from
the keys that are copied from userspace, which means that in the above
example, its value is zero.  That leads to an underflow here:

	blocknr = blocknr - le32_to_cpu(es->s_first_data_block);

The division then operates on -1:

	offset = do_div(blocknr, EXT4_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP(sb)) >>
		EXT4_SB(sb)->s_cluster_bits;

Leaving an impossibly large group number (2^32-1) in blocknr.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2023-53129
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 2, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 31 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: Fix deadlock during directory rename

As lockdep properly warns, we should not be locking i_rwsem while having
transactions started as the proper lock ordering used by all directory
handling operations is i_rwsem -> transaction start. Fix the lock

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2023-53130
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 2, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 31 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: fix wrong mode for blkdev_put() from disk_scan_partitions()

If disk_scan_partitions() is called with 'FMODE_EXCL',
blkdev_get_by_dev() will be called without 'FMODE_EXCL', however, follow
blkdev_put() is still called with 'FMODE_EXCL', which will cause
'bd_holders' counter to leak.

Fix the problem by using the right mode for blkdev_put().

In this case, "copied" always is 0, the infinite loop occurs.

According to the Linux system call man page, 0 should be returned in this
case. Therefore, in tcp_bpf_recvmsg_parser(), if the length is 0, directly
return. Also modify several other functions with the same problem.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2023-53134
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 2, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 31 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnxt_en: Avoid order-5 memory allocation for TPA data

The driver needs to keep track of all the possible concurrent TPA (GRO/LRO)
completions on the aggregation ring.  On P5 chips, the maximum number
of concurrent TPA is 256 and the amount of memory we allocate is order-5
on systems using 4K pages.  Memory allocation failure has been reported:

      <title>CVE-2023-53123 - Linux Kernel PCI s390 Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2023-53123
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 2, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 30 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: s390: Fix use-after-free of PCI resources with per-function hotplug

On s390 PCI functions may be hotplugged individually even when they
belong to a multi-function device. In particular on an SR-IOV device VFs
may be removed and later re-added.

In commit a50297cf8235 ("s390/pci: separate zbus creation from
scanning") it was missed however that struct pci_bus and struct
zpci_bus's resource list retained a reference to the PCI functions MMIO
resources even though those resources are released and freed on
hot-unplug. These stale resources may subsequently be claimed when the
PCI function re-appears resulting in use-after-free.

One idea of fixing this use-after-free in s390 specific code that was
investigated was to simply keep resources around from the moment a PCI
function first appeared until the whole virtual PCI bus created for
a multi-function device disappears. The problem with this however is
that due to the requirement of artificial MMIO addreesses (address
cookies) extra logic is then needed to keep the address cookies
compatible on re-plug. At the same time the MMIO resources semantically
belong to the PCI function so tying their lifecycle to the function
seems more logical.

Instead a simpler approach is to remove the resources of an individually
hot-unplugged PCI function from the PCI bus's resource list while
keeping the resources of other PCI functions on the PCI bus untouched.

This is done by introducing pci_bus_remove_resource() to remove an
individual resource. Similarly the resource also needs to be removed
from the struct zpci_bus's resource list. It turns out however, that
there is really no need to add the MMIO resources to the struct
zpci_bus's resource list at all and instead we can simply use the
zpci_bar_struct's resource pointer directly.

sas_end_device_alloc() or sas_expander_alloc(), all of which may return
NULL. So we need to check the rphy to avoid possible NULL pointer access.

If sas_rphy_add() returned with failure, rphy is set to NULL. We would
access the rphy in the following lines which would also result NULL pointer
access.

      <title>CVE-2025-46569 - Open Policy Agent (OPA) HTTP Data API Code Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46569
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 27 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine. Prior to version 1.4.0, when run as a server, OPA exposes an HTTP Data API for reading and writing documents. Requesting a virtual document through the Data API entails policy evaluation, where a Rego query containing a single data document reference is constructed from the requested path. This query is then used for policy evaluation. A HTTP request path can be crafted in a way that injects Rego code into the constructed query. The evaluation result cannot be made to return any other data than what is generated by the requested path, but this path can be misdirected, and the injected Rego code can be crafted to make the query succeed or fail; opening up for oracle attacks or, given the right circumstances, erroneous policy decision results. Furthermore, the injected code can be crafted to be computationally expensive, resulting in a Denial Of Service (DoS) attack. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.0. A workaround involves having network access to OPA’s RESTful APIs being limited to `localhost` and/or trusted networks, unless necessary for production reasons.

      <title>CVE-2025-46565 - Vite File Pattern Denial of Service</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46565
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 27 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. Prior to versions 6.3.4, 6.2.7, 6.1.6, 5.4.19, and 4.5.14, the contents of files in the project root that are denied by a file matching pattern can be returned to the browser. Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or server.host config option) are affected. Only files that are under project root and are denied by a file matching pattern can be bypassed. `server.fs.deny` can contain patterns matching against files (by default it includes .env, .env.*, *.{crt,pem} as such patterns). These patterns were able to bypass for files under `root` by using a combination of slash and dot (/.). This issue has been patched in versions 6.3.4, 6.2.7, 6.1.6, 5.4.19, and 4.5.14.

      <title>CVE-2022-49911 - Linux kernel netfilter ipset Memory Allocation Denial of Service</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2022-49911
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 1 hour, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: ipset: enforce documented limit to prevent allocating huge memory

Daniel Xu reported that the hash:net,iface type of the ipset subsystem does
not limit adding the same network with different interfaces to a set, which
can lead to huge memory usage or allocation failure.

The quick reproducer is

$ ipset create ACL.IN.ALL_PERMIT hash:net,iface hashsize 1048576 timeout 0
$ for i in $(seq 0 100); do /sbin/ipset add ACL.IN.ALL_PERMIT 0.0.0.0/0,kaf_$i timeout 0 -exist; done

The backtrace when vmalloc fails:

        [Tue Oct 25 00:13:08 2022] ipset: vmalloc error: size 1073741848, exceeds total pages
        <...>
        [Tue Oct 25 00:13:08 2022] Call Trace:

        [Tue Oct 25 00:13:08 2022]  ? hash_netiface4_resize+0x99/0x710
        <...>

The fix is to enforce the limit documented in the ipset(8) manpage:

>  The internal restriction of the hash:net,iface set type is that the same
>  network prefix cannot be stored with more than 64 different interfaces
>  in a single set.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2022-49912
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 1 hour, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix ulist leaks in error paths of qgroup self tests

In the test_no_shared_qgroup() and test_multiple_refs() qgroup self tests,
if we fail to add the tree ref, remove the extent item or remove the
extent ref, we are returning from the test function without freeing the
"old_roots" ulist that was allocated by the previous calls to
btrfs_find_all_roots(). Fix that by calling ulist_free() before returning.

      <title>CVE-2022-49913 - Linux Btrfs Inode List Leak</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2022-49913
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 1 hour, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix inode list leak during backref walking at find_parent_nodes()

During backref walking, at find_parent_nodes(), if we are dealing with a
data extent and we get an error while resolving the indirect backrefs, at
resolve_indirect_refs(), or in the while loop that iterates over the refs
in the direct refs rbtree, we end up leaking the inode lists attached to
the direct refs we have in the direct refs rbtree that were not yet added
to the refs ulist passed as argument to find_parent_nodes(). Since they
were not yet added to the refs ulist and prelim_release() does not free
the lists, on error the caller can only free the lists attached to the
refs that were added to the refs ulist, all the remaining refs get their
inode lists never freed, therefore leaking their memory.

Fix this by having prelim_release() always free any attached inode list
to each ref found in the rbtree, and have find_parent_nodes() set the
ref's inode list to NULL once it transfers ownership of the inode list
to a ref added to the refs ulist passed to find_parent_nodes().

      <title>CVE-2022-49914 - "Btrfs inode list leak vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2022-49914
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 1 hour, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix inode list leak during backref walking at resolve_indirect_refs()

During backref walking, at resolve_indirect_refs(), if we get an error
we jump to the 'out' label and call ulist_free() on the 'parents' ulist,
which frees all the elements in the ulist - however that does not free
any inode lists that may be attached to elements, through the 'aux' field
of a ulist node, so we end up leaking lists if we have any attached to
the unodes.

Fix this by calling free_leaf_list() instead of ulist_free() when we exit
from resolve_indirect_refs(). The static function free_leaf_list() is
moved up for this to be possible and it's slightly simplified by removing
unnecessary code.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2022-49916
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 1 hour, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rose: Fix NULL pointer dereference in rose_send_frame()

The syzkaller reported an issue:

It triggers NULL pointer dereference when 'neigh->dev->dev_addr' is
called in the rose_send_frame(). It's the first occurrence of the
`neigh` is in rose_loopback_timer() as `rose_loopback_neigh', and
the 'dev' in 'rose_loopback_neigh' is initialized sa nullptr.

It had been fixed by commit 3b3fd068c56e3fbea30090859216a368398e39bf
("rose: Fix Null pointer dereference in rose_send_frame()") ever.
But it's introduced by commit 3c53cd65dece47dd1f9d3a809f32e59d1d87b2b8
("rose: check NULL rose_loopback_neigh->loopback") again.

We fix it by add NULL check in rose_transmit_clear_request(). When
the 'dev' in 'neigh' is NULL, we don't reply the request and just
clear it.

syzkaller don't provide repro, and I provide a syz repro like:
r0 = syz_init_net_socket$bt_sco(0x1f, 0x5, 0x2)

      <title>CVE-2022-49919 - Netfilter NF Tables Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2022-49919
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 1 hour, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: release flow rule object from commit path

No need to postpone this to the commit release path, since no packets
are walking over this object, this is accessed from control plane only.
This helped uncovered UAF triggered by races with the netlink notifier.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2022-49920
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 1 hour, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: netlink notifier might race to release objects

commit release path is invoked via call_rcu and it runs lockless to
release the objects after rcu grace period. The netlink notifier handler
might win race to remove objects that the transaction context is still
referencing from the commit release path.

Call rcu_barrier() to ensure pending rcu callbacks run to completion
if the list of transactions to be destroyed is not empty.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2022-49926
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 1 hour, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: Fix possible memory leaks in dsa_loop_init()

kmemleak reported memory leaks in dsa_loop_init():

kmemleak: 12 new suspected memory leaks

unreferenced object 0xffff8880138ce000 (size 2048):
  comm "modprobe", pid 390, jiffies 4295040478 (age 238.976s)
  backtrace:
    [<000000006a94f1d5>] kmalloc_trace+0x26/0x60
    [<00000000a9c44622>] phy_device_create+0x5d/0x970

    [<0000000055223fcb>] dsa_loop_init+0xa9/0x116 [dsa_loop]
    ...

There are two reasons for memleak in dsa_loop_init().

First, fixed_phy_register() create and register phy_device:

fixed_phy_register()
  get_phy_device()
    phy_device_create() # freed by phy_device_free()
  phy_device_register() # freed by phy_device_remove()

But fixed_phy_unregister() only calls phy_device_remove().
So the memory allocated in phy_device_create() is leaked.

Second, when mdio_driver_register() fail in dsa_loop_init(),
it just returns and there is no cleanup for phydevs.

Fix the problems by catching the error of mdio_driver_register()
in dsa_loop_init(), then calling both fixed_phy_unregister() and
phy_device_free() to release phydevs.
Also add a function for phydevs cleanup to avoid duplacate.

      <title>CVE-2022-49931 - IBM HFI1 Null Pointer Dereference</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2022-49931
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 1 hour, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/hfi1: Correctly move list in sc_disable()

Commit 13bac861952a ("IB/hfi1: Fix abba locking issue with sc_disable()")
incorrectly tries to move a list from one list head to another.  The
result is a kernel crash.

The crash is triggered when a link goes down and there are waiters for a
send to complete.  The following signature is seen:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000030
  [...]
  Call Trace:
   sc_disable+0x1ba/0x240 [hfi1]
   pio_freeze+0x3d/0x60 [hfi1]

      <title>CVE-2025-37774 - Linux Kernel Slab Object Extensions Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37774
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

slab: ensure slab->obj_exts is clear in a newly allocated slab page

ktest recently reported crashes while running several buffered io tests
with __alloc_tagging_slab_alloc_hook() at the top of the crash call stack.
The signature indicates an invalid address dereference with low bits of
slab->obj_exts being set. The bits were outside of the range used by
page_memcg_data_flags and objext_flags and hence were not masked out
by slab_obj_exts() when obtaining the pointer stored in slab->obj_exts.
The typical crash log looks like this:

Investigation indicates that these bits are already set when we allocate
slab page and are not zeroed out after allocation. We are not yet sure
why these crashes start happening only recently but regardless of the
reason, not initializing a field that gets used later is wrong. Fix it
by initializing slab->obj_exts during slab page allocation.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Move tcp_transport free to ksmbd_conn_free. If ksmbd connection is
referenced when ksmbd server thread terminates, It will not be freed,
but conn->tcp_transport is freed. __smb2_lease_break_noti can be performed
asynchronously when the connection is disconnected. __smb2_lease_break_noti
calls ksmbd_conn_write, which can cause use-after-free
when conn->ksmbd_transport is already freed.

The refcount of all non-slab folios should be increased to ensure
p9_releas_pages can put them correctly.

      <title>CVE-2025-37780 - Linux Kernel Isofs Fid Handle Bytes Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37780
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

isofs: Prevent the use of too small fid

syzbot reported a slab-out-of-bounds Read in isofs_fh_to_parent. [1]

The handle_bytes value passed in by the reproducing program is equal to 12.
In handle_to_path(), only 12 bytes of memory are allocated for the structure
file_handle->f_handle member, which causes an out-of-bounds access when
accessing the member parent_block of the structure isofs_fid in isofs,
because accessing parent_block requires at least 16 bytes of f_handle.
Here, fh_len is used to indirectly confirm that the value of handle_bytes
is greater than 3 before accessing parent_block.

      <title>CVE-2025-37781 - HP Linux Kernel i2c cros-ec-tunnel NULL Pointer Dereference</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37781
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: cros-ec-tunnel: defer probe if parent EC is not present

When i2c-cros-ec-tunnel and the EC driver are built-in, the EC parent
device will not be found, leading to NULL pointer dereference.

That can also be reproduced by unbinding the controller driver and then
loading i2c-cros-ec-tunnel module (or binding the device).

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37783
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dpu: Fix error pointers in dpu_plane_virtual_atomic_check

The function dpu_plane_virtual_atomic_check was dereferencing pointers
returned by drm_atomic_get_plane_state without checking for errors. This
could lead to undefined behavior if the function returns an error pointer.

This commit adds checks using IS_ERR to ensure that plane_state is
valid before dereferencing them.

Similar to commit da29abe71e16
("drm/amd/display: Fix error pointers in amdgpu_dm_crtc_mem_type_changed").

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ti: icss-iep: Fix possible NULL pointer dereference for perout request

The ICSS IEP driver tracks perout and pps enable state with flags.
Currently when disabling pps and perout signals during icss_iep_exit(),
results in NULL pointer dereference for perout.

To fix the null pointer dereference issue, the icss_iep_perout_enable_hw
function can be modified to directly clear the IEP CMP registers when
disabling PPS or PEROUT, without referencing the ptp_perout_request
structure, as its contents are irrelevant in this case.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37786
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: free routing table on probe failure

If complete = true in dsa_tree_setup(), it means that we are the last
switch of the tree which is successfully probing, and we should be
setting up all switches from our probe path.

After "complete" becomes true, dsa_tree_setup_cpu_ports() or any
subsequent function may fail. If that happens, the entire tree setup is
in limbo: the first N-1 switches have successfully finished probing
(doing nothing but having allocated persistent memory in the tree's
dst->ports, and maybe dst->rtable), and switch N failed to probe, ending
the tree setup process before anything is tangible from the user's PoV.

If switch N fails to probe, its memory (ports) will be freed and removed
from dst->ports. However, the dst->rtable elements pointing to its ports,
as created by dsa_link_touch(), will remain there, and will lead to
use-after-free if dereferenced.

If dsa_tree_setup_switches() returns -EPROBE_DEFER, which is entirely
possible because that is where ds->ops->setup() is, we get a kasan
report like this:

The simplest way to fix the bug is to delete the routing table in its
entirety. dsa_tree_setup_routing_table() has no problem in regenerating
it even if we deleted links between ports other than those of switch N,
because dsa_link_touch() first checks whether the port pair already
exists in dst->rtable, allocating if not.

The deletion of the routing table in its entirety already exists in
dsa_tree_teardown(), so refactor that into a function that can also be
called from the tree setup error path.

In my analysis of the commit to blame, it is the one which added
dsa_link elements to dst->rtable. Prior to that, each switch had its own
ds->rtable which is freed when the switch fails to probe. But the tree
is potentially persistent memory.

      <title>CVE-2025-37787 - Linux Kernel - DSA MV88E6XXX Null Pointer Dereference Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37787
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: avoid unregistering devlink regions which were never registered

Russell King reports that a system with mv88e6xxx dereferences a NULL
pointer when unbinding this driver:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_lRkMlTJ1KQ0kVX@shell.armlinux.org.uk/

The crash seems to be in devlink_region_destroy(), which is not NULL
tolerant but is given a NULL devlink global region pointer.

At least on some chips, some devlink regions are conditionally registered
since the blamed commit, see mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global():

		if (cond && !cond(chip))
			continue;

These are MV88E6XXX_REGION_STU and MV88E6XXX_REGION_PVT. If the chip
does not have an STU or PVT, it should crash like this.

To fix the issue, avoid unregistering those regions which are NULL, i.e.
were skipped at mv88e6xxx_setup_devlink_regions_global() time.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37788
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxgb4: fix memory leak in cxgb4_init_ethtool_filters() error path

In the for loop used to allocate the loc_array and bmap for each port, a
memory leak is possible when the allocation for loc_array succeeds,
but the allocation for bmap fails. This is because when the control flow
goes to the label free_eth_finfo, only the allocations starting from
(i-1)th iteration are freed.

Fix that by freeing the loc_array in the bmap allocation error path.

rpl is passed as a pointer to ethtool_cmis_module_poll(), so the correct
size of rpl is sizeof(*rpl) which should be just 1 byte.  Using the
pointer size instead can cause stack corruption:

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37792
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: btrtl: Prevent potential NULL dereference

The btrtl_initialize() function checks that rtl_load_file() either
had an error or it loaded a zero length file.  However, if it loaded
a zero length file then the error code is not set correctly.  It
results in an error pointer vs NULL bug, followed by a NULL pointer
dereference.  This was detected by Smatch:

drivers/bluetooth/btrtl.c:592 btrtl_initialize() warn: passing zero to 'ERR_PTR'

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37794
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: Purge vif txq in ieee80211_do_stop()

After ieee80211_do_stop() SKB from vif's txq could still be processed.
Indeed another concurrent vif schedule_and_wake_txq call could cause
those packets to be dequeued (see ieee80211_handle_wake_tx_queue())
without checking the sdata current state.

Because vif.drv_priv is now cleared in this function, this could lead to
driver crash.

For example in ath12k, ahvif is store in vif.drv_priv. Thus if
ath12k_mac_op_tx() is called after ieee80211_do_stop(), ahvif->ah can be
NULL, leading the ath12k_warn(ahvif->ah,...) call in this function to
trigger the NULL deref below.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: Update skb's control block key in ieee80211_tx_dequeue()

The ieee80211 skb control block key (set when skb was queued) could have
been removed before ieee80211_tx_dequeue() call. ieee80211_tx_dequeue()
already called ieee80211_tx_h_select_key() to get the current key, but
the latter do not update the key in skb control block in case it is
NULL. Because some drivers actually use this key in their TX callbacks
(e.g. ath1{1,2}k_mac_op_tx()) this could lead to the use after free

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-37796
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 22 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: at76c50x: fix use after free access in at76_disconnect

The memory pointed to by priv is freed at the end of at76_delete_device
function (using ieee80211_free_hw). But the code then accesses the udev
field of the freed object to put the USB device. This may also lead to a
memory leak of the usb device. Fix this by using udev from interface.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-47153
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 21 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Certain build processes for libuv and Node.js for 32-bit systems, such as for the nodejs binary package through nodejs_20.19.0+dfsg-1_i386.deb for Debian GNU/Linux, have an inconsistent off_t size (e.g., building on i386 Debian always uses _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 for the libuv dynamic library, but uses the _FILE_OFFSET_BITS global system default of 32 for nodejs), leading to out-of-bounds access. NOTE: this is not a problem in the Node.js software itself. In particular, the Node.js website's download page does not offer prebuilt Node.js for Linux on i386.

      <title>CVE-2025-2816 - WordPress Page View Count Unauthorized Data Modification Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-2816
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 21 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Page View Count plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to a denial of service due to a missing capability check on the yellow_message_dontshow() function in versions 2.8.0 to 2.8.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update option values to one on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update an option that would create an error on the site and deny service to legitimate users or be used to set some values to true such as registration.

      <title>CVE-2025-4143 - Cloudflare Workers-OAuth-Provider OAuth Redirect URI Validation Bypass</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-4143
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 33 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The OAuth implementation in workers-oauth-provider that is part of  MCP framework https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp , did not correctly validate that redirect_uri was on the allowed list of redirect URIs for the given client registration.

Fixed in:  https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26 

Impact:

 

Under certain circumstances (see below), if a victim had previously authorized with a server built on workers-oath-provider, and an attacker could later trick the victim into visiting a malicious web site, then attacker could potentially steal the victim's credentials to the same OAuth server and subsequently impersonate them.

In order for the attack to be possible, the OAuth server's authorized callback must be designed to auto-approve authorizations that appear to come from an OAuth client that the victim has authorized previously. The authorization flow is not implemented by workers-oauth-provider; it is up to the application built on top to decide whether to implement such automatic re-authorization. However, many applications do implement such logic.

Note: It is a basic, well-known requirement that OAuth servers should verify that the redirect URI is among the allowed list for the client, both during the authorization flow and subsequently when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. workers-oauth-provider implemented only the latter check, not the former. Unfortunately, the former is the much more important check. Readers who are familiar with OAuth may recognize that failing to check redirect URIs against the allowed list is a well-known, basic mistake, covered extensively in the RFC and elsewhere. The author of this library would like everyone to know that he was, in fact, well-aware of this requirement, thought about it a lot while designing the library, and then, somehow, forgot to actually make sure the check was in the code. That is, it's not that he didn't know what he was doing, it's that he knew what he was doing but flubbed it.

      <title>CVE-2025-4144 - Cloudflare Workers-Oauth-Provider PKCE Bypass</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-4144
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> May 1, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 33 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>PKCE was implemented in the OAuth implementation in workers-oauth-provider that is part of  MCP framework https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp . However, it was found that an attacker could cause the check to be skipped.


Fixed in:

 

 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/27 


Impact: 

PKCE is a defense-in-depth mechanism against certain kinds of attacks and was an optional extension in OAuth 2.0 which became required in the OAuth 2.1 draft. (Note that the MCP specification requires OAuth 2.1.). This bug completely bypasses PKCE protection.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32777
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 19 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Volcano is a Kubernetes-native batch scheduling system. Prior to versions 1.11.2, 1.10.2, 1.9.1, 1.11.0-network-topology-preview.3, and 1.12.0-alpha.2, attacker compromise of either the Elastic service or the extender plugin can cause denial of service of the scheduler. This is a privilege escalation, because Volcano users may run their Elastic service and extender plugins in separate pods or nodes from the scheduler. In the Kubernetes security model, node isolation is a security boundary, and as such an attacker is able to cross that boundary in Volcano's case if they have compromised either the vulnerable services or the pod/node in which they are deployed. The scheduler will become unavailable to other users and workloads in the cluster. The scheduler will either crash with an unrecoverable OOM panic or freeze while consuming excessive amounts of memory. This issue has been patched in versions 1.11.2, 1.10.2, 1.9.1, 1.11.0-network-topology-preview.3, and 1.12.0-alpha.2.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 18 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 15.3-rc-1 to before 15.10.14, from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.6, and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.10.0-rc-1, a user who can access pages located in the XWiki space (by default, anyone) can access the page XWiki.Authentication.Administration and (unless an authenticator is set in xwiki.cfg) switch to another installed authenticator. Note that, by default, there is only one authenticator available (Standard XWiki Authenticator). So, if no authenticator extension was installed, it's not really possible to do anything for an attacker. Also, in most cases, if an SSO authenticator is installed and utilized (like OIDC or LDAP for example), the worst an attacker can do is break authentication by switching back to the standard authenticator (that's because it's impossible to login to a user which does not have a stored password, and that's usually what SSO authenticator produce).

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 23 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 4.5.1 to before 15.10.13, from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.4, and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1, the Solr script service doesn't take dropped programming rights into account. The Solr script service that is accessible in XWiki's scripting API normally requires programming rights to be called. Due to using the wrong API for checking rights, it doesn't take the fact into account that programming rights might have been dropped by calling `$xcontext.dropPermissions()`. If some code relies on this for the safety of executing Velocity code with the wrong author context, this could allow a user with script rights to either cause a high load by indexing documents or to temporarily remove documents from the search index. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.13, 16.4.4, and 16.8.0-rc-1.

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 23 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 6.1-milestone-1 to before 15.10.12, from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.3, and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1, the script API of the LESS compiler in XWiki is incorrectly checking for rights when calling the cache cleaning API, making it possible to clean the cache without having programming right. The only impact of this is a slowdown in XWiki execution as the caches are re-filled. As this vulnerability requires script right to exploit, and script right already allows unlimited execution of scripts, the additional impact due to this vulnerability is low. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.12, 16.4.3, and 16.8.0-rc-1.

In versions starting from 15.9-rc-1 to before 15.10.12, from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.4.3, and from 16.5.0-rc-1 to before 16.8.0-rc-1, when a user with programming rights edits a document in XWiki that was last edited by a user without programming rights and contains an XWiki.ComponentClass, there is no warning that this will grant programming rights to this object. An attacker who created such a malicious object could use this to gain programming rights on the wiki. For this, the attacker needs to have edit rights on at least one page to place this object and then get an admin user to edit that document. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.12, 16.4.3, and 16.8.0-rc-1.

      <title>CVE-2025-32974 - XWiki Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32974
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 23 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 15.9-rc-1 to before 15.10.8 and from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.2.0, the required rights analysis doesn't consider TextAreas with default content type. When editing a page, XWiki warns since version 15.9 when there is content on the page like a script macro that would gain more rights due to the editing. This analysis doesn't consider certain kinds of properties, allowing a user to put malicious scripts in there that will be executed after a user with script, admin, or programming rights edited the page. Such a malicious script could impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.8 and 16.2.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-46342 - Kyverno Namespace Selector Bypass Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46342
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 23 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Kyverno is a policy engine designed for cloud native platform engineering teams. Prior to versions 1.13.5 and 1.14.0, it may happen that policy rules using namespace selector(s) in their match statements are mistakenly not applied during admission review request processing due to a missing error propagation in function `GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister` in `pkg/utils/engine/labels.go`. As a consequence, security-critical mutations and validations are bypassed, potentially allowing attackers with K8s API access to perform malicious operations. This issue has been patched in versions 1.13.5 and 1.14.0.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-27134
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. Prior to version 3.3.3, a privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Joplin server, allowing non-admin users to exploit the API endpoint `PATCH /api/users/:id` to set the `is_admin` field to 1. The vulnerability allows malicious low-privileged users to perform administrative actions without proper authorization. This issue has been patched in version 3.3.3.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-27409
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 3:16 p.m. | 3 hours, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Joplin is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. Prior to version 3.3.3, path traversal is possible in Joplin Server if static file path starts with `css/pluginAssets` or `js/pluginAssets`. The `findLocalFile` function in the `default route` calls `localFileFromUrl` to check for special `pluginAssets` paths. If the function returns a path, the result is returned directly, without checking for path traversal. The vulnerability allows attackers to read files outside the intended directories. This issue has been patched in version 3.3.3.

      <title>CVE-2025-30202 - vLLM ZeroMQ Denial of Service and Data Exposure Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30202
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Versions starting from 0.5.2 and prior to 0.8.5 are vulnerable to denial of service and data exposure via ZeroMQ on multi-node vLLM deployment. In a multi-node vLLM deployment, vLLM uses ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes. The primary vLLM host opens an XPUB ZeroMQ socket and binds it to ALL interfaces. While the socket is always opened for a multi-node deployment, it is only used when doing tensor parallelism across multiple hosts. Any client with network access to this host can connect to this XPUB socket unless its port is blocked by a firewall. Once connected, these arbitrary clients will receive all of the same data broadcasted to all of the secondary vLLM hosts. This data is internal vLLM state information that is not useful to an attacker. By potentially connecting to this socket many times and not reading data published to them, an attacker can also cause a denial of service by slowing down or potentially blocking the publisher. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32444
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Versions starting from 0.6.5 and prior to 0.8.5, having vLLM integration with mooncake, are vulnerable to remote code execution due to using pickle based serialization over unsecured ZeroMQ sockets. The vulnerable sockets were set to listen on all network interfaces, increasing the likelihood that an attacker is able to reach the vulnerable ZeroMQ sockets to carry out an attack. vLLM instances that do not make use of the mooncake integration are not vulnerable. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46560
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 30, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>vLLM is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs. Versions starting from 0.8.0 and prior to 0.8.5 are affected by a critical performance vulnerability in the input preprocessing logic of the multimodal tokenizer. The code dynamically replaces placeholder tokens (e.g., <|audio_|>, <|image_|>) with repeated tokens based on precomputed lengths. Due to ​​inefficient list concatenation operations​​, the algorithm exhibits ​​quadratic time complexity (O(n²))​​, allowing malicious actors to trigger resource exhaustion via specially crafted inputs. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46346
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 29, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 4 hours, 8 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. Prior to version 4.5.4, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the application’s comments feature. This issue allows a malicious actor to inject JavaScript payloads that are stored and later executed in the browser of any user viewing the affected comment. The XSS occurs because the application fails to properly sanitize or encode user input submitted to the comments. Notably, the application sanitizes or does not allow execution of `` tags, but does not account for payloads obfuscated using JavaScript block comments like `/* JavaScriptPayload */`. This issue has been patched in version 4.5.4.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3301
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 29, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 14 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>DPA countermeasures are unavailable for ECDH key agreement and EdDSA signing operations on Curve25519 and Curve448 on all Series 2 modules and SoCs due to a lack of hardware and software support. A successful DPA attack may result in exposure of confidential information. The best practice is to use the impacted crypto curves and operations with ephemeral keys to reduce the number of DPA traces that can be collected.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46329
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 29, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 7 hours, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>libsnowflakeclient is the Snowflake Connector for C/C++. Versions starting from 0.5.0 to before 2.2.0, are vulnerable to local logging of sensitive information. When the logging level was set to DEBUG, the Connector would log locally the client-side encryption master key of the target stage during the execution of GET/PUT commands. This key by itself does not grant access to any sensitive data without additional access authorizations, and is not logged server-side by Snowflake. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0.

<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>libsnowflakeclient is the Snowflake Connector for C/C++. Versions starting from 0.5.0 to before 2.2.0, incorrectly treat malformed requests that caused the HTTP response status code 400, as able to be retried.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46338
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 29, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 7 hours, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.21.0, an improper input handling vulnerability in the `/api/upload` endpoint allows an attacker to perform a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by submitting malicious payloads in the `libraryId` field. The unsanitized input is reflected in the server’s error message, enabling arbitrary JavaScript execution in a victim's browser. This issue has been patched in version 2.21.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-46343 - n8n Stored XSS Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46343
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 29, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 7 hours, 12 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>n8n is a workflow automation platform. Prior to version 1.90.0, n8n is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) through the attachments view endpoint. n8n workflows can store and serve binary files, which are accessible to authenticated users. However, there is no restriction on the MIME type of uploaded files, and the MIME type could be controlled via a GET parameter. This allows the server to respond with any MIME type, potentially enabling malicious content to be interpreted and executed by the browser. An authenticated attacker with member-level permissions could exploit this by uploading a crafted HTML file containing malicious JavaScript. When another user visits the binary data endpoint with the MIME type set to text/html, the script executes in the context of the user’s session. This script could send a request to change the user’s email address in their account settings, effectively enabling account takeover. This issue has been patched in version 1.90.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-46326 - Snowflake-Connector-Net TOCTOU Race Condition Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46326
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 28, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 10 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>snowflake-connector-net is the Snowflake Connector for .NET. Versions starting from 2.1.2 to before 4.4.1, are vulnerable to a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition. When using the Easy Logging feature on Linux and macOS, the Connector reads logging configuration from a user-provided file. On Linux and macOS, the Connector verifies that the configuration file can be written to only by its owner. That check was vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition and failed to verify that the file owner matches the user running the Connector. This could allow a local attacker with write access to the configuration file or the directory containing it to overwrite the configuration and gain control over logging level and output location. This issue has been patched in version 4.4.1.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3224
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 28, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 11 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in the update process of Docker Desktop for Windows versions prior to 4.41.0 could allow a local, low-privileged attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM. During an update, Docker Desktop attempts to delete files and subdirectories under the path C:\ProgramData\Docker\config with high privileges. However, this directory often does not exist by default, and C:\ProgramData\ allows normal users to create new directories. By creating a malicious Docker\config folder structure at this location, an attacker can force the privileged update process to delete or manipulate arbitrary system files, leading to Elevation of Privilege.

      <title>CVE-2025-43857 - Net::IMAP Denial of Service Memory Exhaustion Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-43857
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 28, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 26 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Net::IMAP implements Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) client functionality in Ruby. Prior to versions 0.5.7, 0.4.20, 0.3.9, and 0.2.5, there is a possibility for denial of service by memory exhaustion when net-imap reads server responses. At any time while the client is connected, a malicious server can send can send a "literal" byte count, which is automatically read by the client's receiver thread. The response reader immediately allocates memory for the number of bytes indicated by the server response. This should not be an issue when securely connecting to trusted IMAP servers that are well-behaved. It can affect insecure connections and buggy, untrusted, or compromised servers (for example, connecting to a user supplied hostname). This issue has been patched in versions 0.5.7, 0.4.20, 0.3.9, and 0.2.5.

<p>Les « parcours de cybersécurité » avaient pour objectif d’élever la sécurité numérique des services publics, de dynamiser l’industrie de cybersécurité française et européenne et de favoriser des investissements durables au service de la cybersécurité des organisations.</p>
<p>Pendant 4 ans, l’ANSSI a conçu, déployé et piloté un dispositif d’accompagnement au profit des collectivités, des établissements de santé et des entités publiques. Ainsi, 945 entités parmi les plus vulnérables à la menace cyber ont pu bénéficier de cet accompagnement, dont :</p>
<ul><li>707 collectivités territoriales,</li>
<li>134 établissements de santé,</li>
<li>87 autres établissements publics,</li>
<li>17 centres de recherche et d’enseignement supérieur,</li>
</ul><p>Parmi celles-ci, 62 entités ont été accompagnées dans les territoires d’Outre-mer.</p>
<p>Les parcours ont permis d’élever le niveau de cyberdéfense des bénéficiaires de manière significative : en moyenne, les bénéficiaires sont passés d’un score de maturité cyber de D+ à B, soulignant un progrès conséquent. Grâce aux parcours, les entités ont réussi à s’intégrer dans l’écosystème cyber de leur territoire et de leur secteur, en lien avec l’ANSSI, et sont ainsi solidement ancrées dans une démarche de sécurisation à long terme.</p>
<p>Au-delà des bénéfices pour les entités accompagnées, les parcours de cybersécurité laissent un héritage exploitable dans la durée, notamment dans la perspective de la mise en œuvre de la directive NIS 2 avec la mise à disposition d’outils et de méthodes adaptés aux besoins de chaque bénéficiaire.</p>
<p>Le programme a permis de dynamiser l’offre industrielle de cybersécurité dans les territoires et de renforcer l’offre française et européenne de cybersécurité :</p>
<ul><li>197 prestataires présents sur l’ensemble du territoire national ont été impliqués.</li>
<li>40 millions d’euros ont été dédiés à l’acquisition de produits de cybersécurité français et européens (dont 33 millions d’euros pour des produits français).</li>
</ul><p>Les parcours de cybersécurité sont un succès, avec des effets tangibles et durables pour les bénéficiaires. Ils font partie d'un programme plus large de soutien à la transformation numérique et à la résilience des systèmes d'information, dans un contexte où les cybermenaces se multiplient.</p>

<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 26, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 11 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Formidable (aka node-formidable) 2.1.0 through 3.x before 3.5.3 relies on hexoid to prevent guessing of filenames for untrusted executable content; however, hexoid is documented as not "cryptographically secure." (Also, there is a scenario in which only the last two characters of a hexoid string need to be guessed, but this is not often relevant.) NOTE: this does not imply that, in a typical use case, attackers will be able to exploit any hexoid behavior to upload and execute their own content.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-2105
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 26, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 20 hours, 5 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Jupiter X Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.11 via deserialization of untrusted input from the 'file' parameter of the 'raven_download_file' function. This makes it possible for attackers to inject a PHP Object through a PHAR file. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. This vulnerability may be exploited by unauthenticated attackers when a form is present on the site with the file download action, and the ability to upload files is also present. Otherwise, this would be considered exploitable by Contributor-level users and above, because they could create the form needed to successfully exploit this.

      <title>CVE-2025-46333 - Z2D Stride Compositor Out-of-Bounds Write</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46333
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 25, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 1 day, 2 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>z2d is a pure Zig 2D graphics library. In version 0.6.0, when writing from one surface to another using `z2d.compositor.StrideCompositor.run`, the source surface can be completely out-of-bounds on the x-axis (but not on the y-axis) by way of a negative offset. This results in an overflow of the value controlling the length of the stride. In non-safe optimization modes (consumers compiling with `ReleaseFast` or `ReleaseSmall`), this could potentially lead to invalid memory accesses or corruption. This issue is patched in version 0.6.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-3935 - ScreenConnect ASP.NET ViewState Code Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3935
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 25, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 18 hours, 27 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>ScreenConnect versions 25.2.3 and earlier versions may be susceptible to a ViewState code injection attack. ASP.NET Web Forms use ViewState to preserve page and control state, with data encoded using Base64 protected by machine keys. 
It is important to note that to obtain these machine keys, privileged system level access must be obtained. 



If these machine keys are compromised, attackers could create and send a malicious ViewState to the website, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server. 



The risk does not originate from a vulnerability introduced by ScreenConnect, but from platform level behavior.  This had no direct impact to ScreenConnect Client. ScreenConnect 2025.4 patch disables ViewState and removes any dependency on it.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-43862
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 25, 2025, 3:15 p.m. | 15 hours, 2 minutes ago

<strong>Description : </strong>Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 0.6.12, a normal user is able to access and modify APP orchestration, even though the web UI of APP orchestration is not presented for a normal user. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to make unauthorized access and changes on the APPSs. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can access Orchestration of the APPs.

      <title>CVE-2025-46595 - Backdrop CMS Flag Module Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-46595
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 25, 2025, 3:15 a.m. | 8 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An XSS issue was discovered in the Flag module before 1.x-3.6.2 for Backdrop CMS. Flag is a module that allows flags to be added to nodes, comments, users, and any other type of entity. It doesn't verify flag links before performing the flag action, or verify that the response returned was provided by the flag module. This can allow crafted HTML to result in Cross Site Scripting. This is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with permission to create links on the website, for example: create or edit comments or content with a filtered text format.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-43864
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 25, 2025, 1:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>React Router is a router for React. Starting in version 7.2.0 and prior to version 7.5.2, it is possible to force an application to switch to SPA mode by adding a header to the request. If the application uses SSR and is forced to switch to SPA, this causes an error that completely corrupts the page. If a cache system is in place, this allows the response containing the error to be cached, resulting in a cache poisoning that strongly impacts the availability of the application. This issue has been patched in version 7.5.2.

      <title>CVE-2025-43859 - Apache h11 Chunked-Coding Request Smuggling Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-43859
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 24, 2025, 7:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>h11 is a Python implementation of HTTP/1.1. Prior to version 0.16.0, a leniency in h11's parsing of line terminators in chunked-coding message bodies can lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities under certain conditions. This issue has been patched in version 0.16.0. Since exploitation requires the combination of buggy h11 with a buggy (reverse) proxy, fixing either component is sufficient to mitigate this issue.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3607
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 24, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 58 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Frontend Login and Registration Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating a password. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.

      <title>CVE-2025-21605 - Redis Unauthenticated Output Buffer Overflow Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21605
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 23, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In versions starting at 2.6 and prior to 7.4.3, An unauthenticated client can cause unlimited growth of output buffers, until the server runs out of memory or is killed. By default, the Redis configuration does not limit the output buffer of normal clients (see client-output-buffer-limit). Therefore, the output buffer can grow unlimitedly over time. As a result, the service is exhausted and the memory is unavailable. When password authentication is enabled on the Redis server, but no password is provided, the client can still cause the output buffer to grow from "NOAUTH" responses until the system will run out of memory. This issue has been patched in version 7.4.3. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways. Either using network access control tools like firewalls, iptables, security groups, etc, or enabling TLS and requiring users to authenticate using client side certificates.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32968
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 23, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In versions starting from 1.6-milestone-1 to before 15.10.16, 16.4.6, and 16.10.1, it is possible for a user with SCRIPT right to escape from the HQL execution context and perform a blind SQL injection to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the database backend. Depending on the used database backend, the attacker may be able to not only obtain confidential information such as password hashes from the database, but also execute UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries. This issue has been patched in versions 16.10.1, 16.4.6 and 15.10.16. There is no known workaround, other than upgrading XWiki. The protection added to this REST API is the same as the one used to validate complete select queries, making it more consistent. However, while the script API always had this protection for complete queries, it's important to note that it's a very strict protection and some valid, but complex, queries might suddenly require the author to have programming right.

      <title>CVE-2025-32965 - XRP Ledger Malicious Code Exfiltration in xrpl.js</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32965
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 22, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 12 hours, 27 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>xrpl.js is a JavaScript/TypeScript API for interacting with the XRP Ledger in Node.js and the browser. Versions 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, and 4.2.4 of xrpl.js were compromised and contained malicious code designed to exfiltrate private keys. Version 2.14.2 is also malicious, though it is less likely to lead to exploitation as it is not compatible with other 2.x versions. Anyone who used one of these versions should stop immediately and rotate any private keys or secrets used with affected systems. Users of xrpl.js should pgrade to version 4.2.5 or 2.14.3 to receive a patch. To secure funds, think carefully about whether any keys may have been compromised by this supply chain attack, and mitigate by sending funds to secure wallets, and/or rotating keys. If any account's master key is potentially compromised, disable the key.

      <title>CVE-2025-32955 - Harden-Runner Docker Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32955
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 21, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 19 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Harden-Runner is a CI/CD security agent that works like an EDR for GitHub Actions runners. Versions from 0.12.0 to before 2.12.0 are vulnerable to `disable-sudo` bypass. Harden-Runner includes a policy option `disable-sudo` to prevent the GitHub Actions runner user from using sudo. This is implemented by removing the runner user from the sudoers file. However, this control can be bypassed as the runner user, being part of the docker group, can interact with the Docker daemon to launch privileged containers or access the host filesystem. This allows the attacker to regain root access or restore the sudoers file, effectively bypassing the restriction. This issue has been patched in version 2.12.0.

      <title>CVE-2025-32958 - Adept Language GitHub Token Exposure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32958
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 21, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 19 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Adept is a language for general purpose programming. Prior to commit a1a41b7, the remoteBuild.yml workflow file uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the mac-standalone artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated .git/config file containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the Github API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in the AdeptLanguage/Adept repository. This issue has been patched in commit a1a41b7.

      <title>CVE-2025-32431 - Traefik Path Traversal Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32431
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 21, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 7 hours, 18 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Traefik (pronounced traffic) is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. In versions prior to 2.11.24, 3.3.6, and 3.4.0-rc2. There is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing the requests using a PathPrefix, Path or PathRegex matcher. When Traefik is configured to route the requests to a backend using a matcher based on the path, if the URL contains a /../ in its path, it’s possible to target a backend, exposed using another router, by-passing the middlewares chain. This issue has been patched in versions 2.11.24, 3.3.6, and 3.4.0-rc2. A workaround involves adding a `PathRegexp` rule to the matcher to prevent matching a route with a `/../` in the path.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-29953
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 18, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ NMS OpenWire Client.

This issue affects Apache ActiveMQ NMS OpenWire Client before 2.1.1 when performing connections to untrusted servers. Such servers could abuse the unbounded deserialization in the client to provide malicious responses that may eventually cause arbitrary code execution on the client. Version 2.1.0 introduced a allow/denylist feature to restrict deserialization, but this feature could be bypassed.

The .NET team has deprecated the built-in .NET binary serialization feature starting with .NET 9 and suggests migrating away from binary serialization. The project is considering to follow suit and drop this part of the NMS API altogether.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.1, which fixes the issue. We also recommend to migrate away from relying on .NET binary serialization as a hardening method for the future.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-31120
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 18, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>NamelessMC is a free, easy to use & powerful website software for Minecraft servers. In version 2.1.4 and prior, an insecure view count mechanism in the forum page allows an unauthenticated attacker to artificially increase the view count. The application relies on a client-side cookie (nl-topic-[tid]) (or session variable for guests) to determine if a view should be counted. When a client does not provide the cookie, every page request increments the counter, leading to incorrect view metrics. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32792
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 18, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>SES safely executes third-party JavaScript 'strict' mode programs in compartments that have no excess authority in their global scope. Prior to version 1.12.0, web pages and web extensions using `ses` and the Compartment API to evaluate third-party code in an isolated execution environment that have also elsewhere used `const`, `let`, and `class` bindings in the top-level scope of a `` tag will have inadvertently revealed these bindings in the lexical scope of third-party code. This issue has been patched in version 1.12.0. Workarounds for this issue involve either avoiding top-level `let`, `const`, or `class` bindings in `` tags, or change these to `var` bindings to be reflected on `globalThis`.

<strong>Published : </strong> April 18, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 0.6.12, a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY where normal users are improperly granted permissions to edit APP names, descriptions and icons. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to modify app details, despite being restricted from viewing apps, which poses a security risk to the integrity of the application. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can modify app details.

<strong>Published : </strong> April 18, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 3 hours, 35 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Prior to version 0.6.12, a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY where normal users can enable or disable apps through the API, even though the web UI button for this action is disabled and normal users are not permitted to make such changes.

      <title>CVE-2025-39735 - Linux Kernel JFS Slab Out-of-Bounds Read Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-39735
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 18, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: fix slab-out-of-bounds read in ea_get()

During the "size_check" label in ea_get(), the code checks if the extended
attribute list (xattr) size matches ea_size. If not, it logs
"ea_get: invalid extended attribute" and calls print_hex_dump().

Here, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr) returns 4110417968, which exceeds
INT_MAX (2,147,483,647). Then ea_size is clamped:

	int size = clamp_t(int, ea_size, 0, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr));

Although clamp_t aims to bound ea_size between 0 and 4110417968, the upper
limit is treated as an int, causing an overflow above 2^31 - 1. This leads
"size" to wrap around and become negative (-184549328).

The "size" is then passed to print_hex_dump() (called "len" in
print_hex_dump()), it is passed as type size_t (an unsigned
type), this is then stored inside a variable called
"int remaining", which is then assigned to "int linelen" which
is then passed to hex_dump_to_buffer(). In print_hex_dump()
the for loop, iterates through 0 to len-1, where len is
18446744073525002176, calling hex_dump_to_buffer()
on each iteration:

	for (i = 0; i < len; i += rowsize) {
		linelen = min(remaining, rowsize);
		remaining -= rowsize;

		hex_dump_to_buffer(ptr + i, linelen, rowsize, groupsize,
				   linebuf, sizeof(linebuf), ascii);

		...
	}

The expected stopping condition (i < len) is effectively broken
since len is corrupted and very large. This eventually leads to
the "ptr+i" being passed to hex_dump_to_buffer() to get closer
to the end of the actual bounds of "ptr", eventually an out of
bounds access is done in hex_dump_to_buffer() in the following
for loop:

	for (j = 0; j < len; j++) {
			if (linebuflen < lx + 2)
				goto overflow2;
			ch = ptr[j];
		...
	}

To fix this we should validate "EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr)"
before it is utilised.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-39989
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 18, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/mce: use is_copy_from_user() to determine copy-from-user context

Patch series "mm/hwpoison: Fix regressions in memory failure handling",
v4.

## 1. What am I trying to do:

This patchset resolves two critical regressions related to memory failure
handling that have appeared in the upstream kernel since version 5.17, as
compared to 5.10 LTS.

    - copyin case: poison found in user page while kernel copying from user space
    - instr case: poison found while instruction fetching in user space

## 2. What is the expected outcome and why

- For copyin case:

Kernel can recover from poison found where kernel is doing get_user() or
copy_from_user() if those places get an error return and the kernel return
-EFAULT to the process instead of crashing.  More specifily, MCE handler
checks the fixup handler type to decide whether an in kernel #MC can be
recovered.  When EX_TYPE_UACCESS is found, the PC jumps to recovery code
specified in _ASM_EXTABLE_FAULT() and return a -EFAULT to user space.

- For instr case:

If a poison found while instruction fetching in user space, full recovery
is possible.  User process takes #PF, Linux allocates a new page and fills
by reading from storage.


## 3. What actually happens and why

- For copyin case: kernel panic since v5.17

Commit 4c132d1d844a ("x86/futex: Remove .fixup usage") introduced a new
extable fixup type, EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG, and later patches updated the
extable fixup type for copy-from-user operations, changing it from
EX_TYPE_UACCESS to EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG.  It breaks previous EX_TYPE_UACCESS
handling when posion found in get_user() or copy_from_user().

- For instr case: user process is killed by a SIGBUS signal due to #CMCI
  and #MCE race

When an uncorrected memory error is consumed there is a race between the
CMCI from the memory controller reporting an uncorrected error with a UCNA
signature, and the core reporting and SRAR signature machine check when
the data is about to be consumed.

### Background: why *UN*corrected errors tied to *C*MCI in Intel platform [1]

Prior to Icelake memory controllers reported patrol scrub events that
detected a previously unseen uncorrected error in memory by signaling a
broadcast machine check with an SRAO (Software Recoverable Action
Optional) signature in the machine check bank.  This was overkill because
it's not an urgent problem that no core is on the verge of consuming that
bad data.  It's also found that multi SRAO UCE may cause nested MCE
interrupts and finally become an IERR.

Hence, Intel downgrades the machine check bank signature of patrol scrub
from SRAO to UCNA (Uncorrected, No Action required), and signal changed to
#CMCI.  Just to add to the confusion, Linux does take an action (in
uc_decode_notifier()) to try to offline the page despite the UC*NA*
signature name.

### Background: why #CMCI and #MCE race when poison is consuming in
    Intel platform [1]

Having decided that CMCI/UCNA is the best action for patrol scrub errors,
the memory controller uses it for reads too.  But the memory controller is
executing asynchronously from the core, and can't tell the difference
between a "real" read and a speculative read.  So it will do CMCI/UCNA if
an error is found in any read.

Thus:

1) Core is clever and thinks address A is needed soon, issues a
   speculative read.

2) Core finds it is going to use address A soon after sending the read
   request

3) The CMCI from the memory controller is in a race with MCE from the
   core that will soon try to retire the load from address A.

Quite often (because speculation has got better) the CMCI from the memory
controller is delivered before the core is committed to the instruction
reading address A, so the interrupt is taken, and Linux offlines the page
(marking it as poison).


## Why user process is killed for instr case

<strong>Published : </strong> April 18, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 9 hours, 6 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

objtool, spi: amd: Fix out-of-bounds stack access in amd_set_spi_freq()

If speed_hz < AMD_SPI_MIN_HZ, amd_set_spi_freq() iterates over the
entire amd_spi_freq array without breaking out early, causing 'i' to go
beyond the array bounds.

Fix that by stopping the loop when it gets to the last entry, so the low
speed_hz value gets clamped up to AMD_SPI_MIN_HZ.

Fixes the following warning with an UBSAN kernel:

  drivers/spi/spi-amd.o: error: objtool: amd_set_spi_freq() falls through to next function amd_spi_set_opcode()

<p>Tout au long de l’année, le contexte des Jeux Olympiques et Paralympiques de Paris 2024 a mis en lumière l’exposition de ce secteur aux cyberattaques, les tensions géopolitiques ayant été un catalyseur fort de cette menace avec de nombreuses attaques par déni de services.</p>
<p>L’imbrication de plusieurs réseaux informatiques de grande taille ainsi que la diversité des équipements qui les composent met en exergue des niveaux de sécurisation hétérogène complexifiant d’autant plus les questions de sécurité des systèmes d’information et augmentant significativement la surface d’attaque.</p>
<p>Les entités du secteur sont également fortement ciblées en raison du grand nombre de données personnelles des usagers, ainsi une attention toute particulière doit être portée à la protection de ces bases de données qui font régulièrement l’objet d’attaques à des fins d’exfiltration.</p>
<h3><strong>Prévenir et se protéger contre ces menaces</strong></h3>
<p>Dans son état de la menace, l’ANSSI rappelle l’importance d’avoir une approche globale de la sécurité et recommande aux entités de réaliser une cartographie globale des systèmes d’information afin d’identifier les risques affectant l’entité ou encore mesurer la maturité des systèmes d’informations concernés.</p>
<p>Il est essentiel de travailler sur des modes de fonctionnement dégradé notamment pour assurer et préparer en parallèle un <strong>plan de continuité d’activité (PCA)</strong> et un <strong>plan de reprise d’activité (PRA)</strong>. La mise en pratique ces recommandations permettra au secteur des transports urbains d’anticiper ces menaces.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3578
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 15, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 3 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A malicious, authenticated user in Aidex, versions prior to 1.7, could list credentials of other users, create or modify existing users in the application, list credentials of users in production or development environments. In addition, it would be possible to cause bugs that would result in the exfiltration of sensitive information, such as details about the software or internal system paths. These actions could be carried out through the misuse of LLM Prompt (chatbot) technology, via the /api/<string-chat>/message endpoint, by manipulating the contents of the ‘content’ parameter.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3579
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 15, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 3 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In versions prior to Aidex 1.7, an authenticated malicious user, taking advantage of an open registry, could execute unauthorised commands within the system. This includes executing operating system (Unix) commands, interacting with internal services such as PHP or MySQL, and even invoking native functions of the framework used, such as Laravel or Symfony. This execution is achieved by Prompt Injection attacks through the /api/<string-chat>/message endpoint, manipulating the content of the ‘content’ parameter.

<h3><strong>Les Jeux olympiques et paralympiques de Paris 2024 comme consécration du modèle français de cyberdéfense</strong></h3>
<p>En tant que cheffe de file du volet cyber, l’ANSSI a été au cœur de la préparation des Jeux olympiques et paralympiques de Paris 2024. Le succès de cet événement international majeur est un accomplissement pour l’Agence, qui témoigne également de la pertinence du modèle de cyberdéfense français bâti autour d’une autorité nationale et ancré dans un écosystème élargi et déployé dans les territoires. Les Jeux sont le résultat d’une méthode – anticipation, préparation, entraînement – et d’une équipe – l’écosystème cyber public et privé – qui doivent perdurer pour<strong> permettre à la France de rester parmi les grandes nations de la cybersécurité.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>La directive NIS 2, vecteur d’une transformation profonde pour l’ANSSI</strong></h3>
<p>En 2024, l’ANSSI a poursuivi ses travaux de transposition de la directive NIS 2 qui sont le moteur d’un changement majeur de son organisation, de ses méthodes et de sa manière d’interagir avec ses bénéficiaires et ses partenaires. Déjà fortement mobilisées sur le sujet au cours des dernières années, les équipes de l’Agence continueront de l’être au quotidien, en coordination avec l’écosystème cyber, pour accompagner des milliers d’entités dans leur cybersécurité.</p>
<h3><strong>Des progrès précieux pour l’élévation générale de la cybersécurité de l’Union européenne</strong></h3>
<p>À l’image du cadre réglementaire défini par NIS 2, ou encore du vote du règlement sur la résilience cyber, pour lesquels l’ANSSI s’est pleinement engagée, la cybersécurité en Europe a connu de belles avancées en 2024. Par ailleurs, face aux évolutions technologiques, et notamment aux technologies de rupture, la conservation d’une maîtrise souveraine des expertises techniques s’impose comme une mission essentielle de l’ANSSI.</p>
<h4><strong>L’année 2024 en quelques chiffres :</strong></h4>
<ul><li><strong>656 </strong>agents âgés en moyenne de <strong>36 </strong>ans, œuvrent au quotidien pour la cybersécurité de la Nation, au sein de l’ANSSI.</li>
<li><strong>4 386 (+15%)</strong> événements de sécurité traités par l’ANSSI, et <strong>1 361 (+18%)</strong> incidents ayant impliqué un acteur malveillant.</li>
<li><strong>68</strong> formations labellisées SecNumedu, <strong>1 696</strong> personnes formées au Centre de formation à la sécurité des systèmes d’information (CFSSI) et <strong>117 856</strong> attestations SecNumacadémie décernées.</li>
</ul><h4><strong>L’année 2024 en quelques dates clés :</strong></h4>
<p>Au-delà des JOP24 d’autres d’événements ont marqué l’année 2024 :</p>
<ul><li><strong>31 janvier</strong> : Adoption du schéma européen de certification de cybersécurité fondé sur des critères commun.</li>
<li><strong>10 mai </strong>: Entrée en vigueur du décret d’application de la loi de programmation militaire 2024-2030, permettant à l’ANSSI de mettre en œuvre l’ensemble des nouvelles capacités dont elle l’a dotée.</li>
<li><strong>9 juillet </strong>: Publications des recommandations de l’ANSSI pour l’hébergement des systèmes d’information sensible dans le cloud.</li>
<li><strong>15 octobre </strong>: Présentation en conseil des ministres du projet de loi relatif à la résilience des activités d’importance vitale, à la protection des infrastructures critiques à la cybersécurité et à la résilience opérationnelle du secteur financier dont le titre II, Cybersécurité, vise à transposer la directive NIS 2.</li>

      <title>CVE-2025-31491 - "AutoGPT Cross-Domain Cookie and Header Leakage Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-31491
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 15, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 6 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to 0.6.1, AutoGPT allows of leakage of cross-domain cookies and protected headers in requests redirect. AutoGPT uses a wrapper around the requests python library, located in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. In this wrapper, redirects are specifically NOT followed for the first request. If the wrapper is used with allow_redirects set to True (which is the default), any redirect is not followed by the initial request, but rather re-requested by the wrapper using the new location. However, there is a fundamental flaw in manually re-requesting the new location: it does not account for security-sensitive headers which should not be sent cross-origin, such as the Authorization and Proxy-Authorization header, and cookies. For example in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/blocks/github/_api.py, an Authorization header is set when retrieving data from the GitHub API. However, if GitHub suffers from an open redirect vulnerability (such as the made-up example of https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment_id}/../../../../../redirect/?url=https://joshua.hu/), and the script can be coerced into visiting it with the Authorization header, the GitHub credentials in the Authorization header will be leaked. This allows leaking auth headers and private cookies. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-31494 - AutoGPT WebSocket API Graph ID Spoofing Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-31494
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 15, 2025, 12:15 a.m. | 6 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. The AutoGPT Platform's WebSocket API transmitted node execution updates to subscribers based on the graph_id+graph_version. Additionally, there was no check prohibiting users from subscribing with another user's graph_id+graph_version. As a result, node execution updates from one user's graph execution could be received by another user within the same instance. This vulnerability does not occur between different instances or between users and non-users of the platform. Single-user instances are not affected. In private instances with a user white-list, the impact is limited by the fact that all potential unintended recipients of these node execution updates must have been admitted by the administrator. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-31490 - AutoGPT SSRF via DNS Rebinding</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-31490
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 14, 2025, 11:15 p.m. | 7 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to 0.6.1, AutoGPT allows SSRF due to DNS Rebinding in requests wrapper. AutoGPT is built with a wrapper around Python's requests library, hardening the application against SSRF. The code for this wrapper can be found in autogpt_platform/backend/backend/util/request.py. The requested hostname of a URL which is being requested is validated, ensuring that it does not resolve to any local ipv4 or ipv6 addresses. However, this check is not sufficient, as a DNS server may initially respond with a non-blocked address, with a TTL of 0. This means that the initial resolution would appear as a non-blocked address. In this case, validate_url() will return the url as successful. After validate_url() has successfully returned the url, the url is then passed to the real request() function. When the real request() function is called with the validated url, request() will once again resolve the address of the hostname, because the record will not have been cached (due to TTL 0). This resolution may be in the "invalid range". This type of attack is called a "DNS Rebinding Attack". This vulnerability is fixed in 0.6.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-3445 - Apache Archiver Path Traversal Zip Slip Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3445
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 13, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 10 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A Path Traversal "Zip Slip" vulnerability has been identified in mholt/archiver in Go. This vulnerability allows using a crafted ZIP file containing path traversal symlinks to create or overwrite files with the user's privileges or application utilizing the library.

When using the archiver.Unarchive functionality with ZIP files, like this: archiver.Unarchive(zipFile, outputDir),  A crafted ZIP file can be extracted in such a way that it writes files to the affected system with the same privileges as the application executing this vulnerable functionality. Consequently, sensitive files may be overwritten, potentially leading to privilege escalation, code execution, and other severe outcomes in some cases.

It's worth noting that a similar vulnerability was found in TAR files (CVE-2024-0406). Although a fix was implemented, it hasn't been officially released, and the affected project has since been deprecated. The successor to mholt/archiver is a new project called mholt/archives, and its initial release (v0.1.0) removes the Unarchive() functionality.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-0123
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 11, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 1 day, 18 hours ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A vulnerability in the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS® software enables unlicensed administrators to view clear-text data captured using the  packet capture feature https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-0/pan-os-admin/monitoring/take-packet-captures/take-a-custom-packet-capture  in decrypted HTTP/2 data streams traversing network interfaces on the firewall. HTTP/1.1 data streams are not impacted.

In normal conditions, decrypted packet captures are available to firewall administrators after they obtain and install a free Decryption Port Mirror license. The license requirement ensures that this feature can only be used after approved personnel purposefully activate the license. For more information, review how to  configure decryption port mirroring https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/decryption/administration/monitoring-decryption/configure-decryption-port-mirroring .

The administrator must obtain network access to the management interface (web, SSH, console, or telnet) and successfully authenticate to exploit this issue. Risk of this issue can be greatly reduced by restricting access to the management interface to only trusted administrators and from only internal IP addresses according to our recommended  critical deployment guidelines https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431 .

Customer firewall administrators do not have access to the packet capture feature in Cloud NGFW. This feature is available only to authorized Palo Alto Networks personnel permitted to perform troubleshooting.

Prisma® Access is not impacted by this vulnerability.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3417
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 10, 2025, 7:15 a.m. | 1 hour, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Embedder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data that can lead to privilege escalation due to a missing capability check on the ajax_set_global_option() function in versions 1.3 to 1.3.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30656
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 9, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An Improper Handling of Additional Special Element vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MS-MPC, MS-MIC and SPC3, and SRX Series, allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

If the SIP ALG processes specifically formatted SIP invites, a memory corruption will occur which will lead to a crash of the FPC processing these packets. Although the system will automatically recover with the restart of the FPC, subsequent SIP invites will cause the crash again and lead to a sustained DoS.

<strong>Description : </strong>An Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output vulnerability in the Sampling Route Record Daemon (SRRD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

When a device configured for flow-monitoring receives a specific BGP update message, it is correctly processed internally by the routing protocol daemon (rpd), but when it's sent to SRRD it's encoded incorrectly which leads to a crash and momentary interruption of jflow processing until it automatically restarts. This issue does not affect traffic forwarding itself.
This issue affects Junos OS: 



  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9,
  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S10,
  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6,
  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3,
  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R1-S2, 23.2R2.



This issue does not affected Junos OS Evolved.

      <title>CVE-2025-30658 - Juniper Networks Junos OS SRX Series Anti-Virus Memory Leak Denial-of-Service Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30658
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 9, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Anti-Virus processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series 

allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

On all SRX platforms with Anti-Virus enabled, if a server sends specific content in the HTTP body of a response to a client request, these packets are queued by Anti-Virus processing in Juniper Buffers (jbufs) which are never released. When these jbufs are exhausted, the device stops forwarding all transit traffic.

A jbuf memory leak can be noticed from the following logs:

(<node>.)<fpc> Warning: jbuf pool id <#> utilization level (<current level>%) is above <threshold>%!

To recover from this issue, the affected device needs to be manually rebooted to free the leaked jbufs.




This issue affects Junos OS on SRX Series: 

  *  all versions before 21.2R3-S9,
  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S10,
  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S6,
  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S6,
  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2-S3,
  *  23.4 versions before 23.4R2-S3,
  *  24.2 versions before 24.2R2.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30652
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 9, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 8 hours, 3 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local, low-privileged attacker executing a CLI command to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

When asregex-optimized is configured and a specific "show route as-path" CLI command  is executed, the rpd crashes and restarts. Repeated execution of this command will cause a sustained DoS condition.
This issue affects Junos OS: 


  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9, 
  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10, 
  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6, 
  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S6, 
  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3, 
  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S4, 
  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2.



and Junos OS Evolved: 
  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9-EVO, 
  *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S10-EVO, 
  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S6-EVO, 
  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S6-EVO, 
  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S3-EVO,

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-2525
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 8, 2025, 2:15 a.m. | 1 hour ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Streamit theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'st_Authentication_Controller::edit_profile' function in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-2526 - Streamit Theme for WordPress Privilege Escalation via Account Takeover</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-2526
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 8, 2025, 2:15 a.m. | 1 hour ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Streamit theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.2. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email in the 'st_Authentication_Controller::edit_profile' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.

      <title>CVE-2025-32033 - Apollo Router Core Unsigned Integer Wraparound Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32033
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 7, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Apollo Router Core is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. Prior to 1.61.2 and 2.1.1, the operation limits plugin uses unsigned 32-bit integers to track limit counters (e.g. for a query's height). If a counter exceeded the maximum value for this data type (4,294,967,295), it wrapped around to 0, unintentionally allowing queries to bypass configured thresholds. This could occur for large queries if the payload limit were sufficiently increased, but could also occur for small queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments. This has been remediated in apollo-router versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-32034
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 7, 2025, 9:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 59 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Apollo Router Core is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation 2. Prior to 1.61.2 and 2.1.1, a vulnerability in Apollo Router allowed queries with deeply nested and reused named fragments to be prohibitively expensive to query plan, specifically during named fragment expansion. Named fragments were being expanded once per fragment spread during query planning, leading to exponential resource usage when deeply nested and reused fragments were involved. This could lead to excessive resource consumption and denial of service. This has been remediated in apollo-router versions 1.61.2 and 2.1.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-30370 - Jupyterlab-Git Command Injection Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30370
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 3, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 46 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>jupyterlab-git is a JupyterLab extension for version control using Git. On many platforms, a third party can create a Git repository under a name that includes a shell command substitution string in the syntax $(<command>). These directory names are allowed in macOS and a majority of Linux distributions. If a user starts jupyter-lab in a parent directory of this inappropriately-named Git repository, opens it, and clicks "Git > Open Git Repository in Terminal" from the menu bar, then the injected command <command> is run in the user's shell without the user's permission. This issue is occurring because when that menu entry is clicked, jupyterlab-git opens the terminal and runs cd <git-repo-path> through the shell to set the current directory. Doing so runs any command substitution strings present in the directory name, which leads to the command injection issue described here. A previous patch provided an incomplete fix. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.51.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-21996 - Radeon Linux Kernel Uninitialized Variable Use</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21996
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 3, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/radeon: fix uninitialized size issue in radeon_vce_cs_parse()

On the off chance that command stream passed from userspace via
ioctl() call to radeon_vce_cs_parse() is weirdly crafted and
first command to execute is to encode (case 0x03000001), the function
in question will attempt to call radeon_vce_cs_reloc() with size
argument that has not been properly initialized. Specifically, 'size'
will point to 'tmp' variable before the latter had a chance to be
assigned any value.

Play it safe and init 'tmp' with 0, thus ensuring that
radeon_vce_cs_reloc() will catch an early error in cases like these.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static
analysis tool SVACE.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21999
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 3, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

proc: fix UAF in proc_get_inode()

Fix race between rmmod and /proc/XXX's inode instantiation.

The bug is that pde->proc_ops don't belong to /proc, it belongs to a
module, therefore dereferencing it after /proc entry has been registered
is a bug unless use_pde/unuse_pde() pair has been used.

use_pde/unuse_pde can be avoided (2 atomic ops!) because pde->proc_ops
never changes so information necessary for inode instantiation can be
saved _before_ proc_register() in PDE itself and used later, avoiding
pde->proc_ops->...  dereference.

      rmmod                         lookup
sys_delete_module
                         proc_lookup_de
			   pde_get(de);
			   proc_get_inode(dir->i_sb, de);
  mod->exit()
    proc_remove

	                         if (de->proc_ops->proc_read_iter)
                           --> As module is already freed, will trigger UAF

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-22000
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 3, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/huge_memory: drop beyond-EOF folios with the right number of refs

When an after-split folio is large and needs to be dropped due to EOF,
folio_put_refs(folio, folio_nr_pages(folio)) should be used to drop all
page cache refs.  Otherwise, the folio will not be freed, causing memory
leak.

This leak would happen on a filesystem with blocksize > page_size and a
truncate is performed, where the blocksize makes folios split to >0 order
ones, causing truncated folios not being freed.

      <title>CVE-2025-22003 - Linux Kernel CAN Ucan Out-of-Bound Read Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-22003
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 3, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: ucan: fix out of bound read in strscpy() source

Commit 7fdaf8966aae ("can: ucan: use strscpy() to instead of strncpy()")
unintentionally introduced a one byte out of bound read on strscpy()'s
source argument (which is kind of ironic knowing that strscpy() is meant
to be a more secure alternative :)).

Let's consider below buffers:

  dest[len + 1]; /* will be NUL terminated */
  src[len]; /* may not be NUL terminated */

When doing:

  strncpy(dest, src, len);
  dest[len] = '\0';

strncpy() will read up to len bytes from src.

On the other hand:

  strscpy(dest, src, len + 1);

will read up to len + 1 bytes from src, that is to say, an out of bound
read of one byte will occur on src if it is not NUL terminated. Note
that the src[len] byte is never copied, but strscpy() still needs to
read it to check whether a truncation occurred or not.

This exact pattern happened in ucan.

The root cause is that the source is not NUL terminated. Instead of
doing a copy in a local buffer, directly NUL terminate it as soon as
usb_control_msg() returns. With this, the local firmware_str[] variable
can be removed.

On top of this do a couple refactors:

  - ucan_ctl_payload->raw is only used for the firmware string, so
    rename it to ucan_ctl_payload->fw_str and change its type from u8 to
    char.

  - ucan_device_request_in() is only used to retrieve the firmware
    string, so rename it to ucan_get_fw_str() and refactor it to make it
    directly handle all the string termination logic.

      <title>CVE-2025-22005 - Linux Kernel IPv6 Memory Leak Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-22005
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 3, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: Fix memleak of nhc_pcpu_rth_output in fib_check_nh_v6_gw().

fib_check_nh_v6_gw() expects that fib6_nh_init() cleans up everything
when it fails.

Commit 7dd73168e273 ("ipv6: Always allocate pcpu memory in a fib6_nh")
moved fib_nh_common_init() before alloc_percpu_gfp() within fib6_nh_init()
but forgot to add cleanup for fib6_nh->nh_common.nhc_pcpu_rth_output in
case it fails to allocate fib6_nh->rt6i_pcpu, resulting in memleak.

Let's call fib_nh_common_release() and clear nhc_pcpu_rth_output in the
error path.

Note that we can remove the fib6_nh_release() call in nh_create_ipv6()
later in net-next.git.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-22006
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 3, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 5 hours, 43 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: Fix NAPI registration sequence

Registering the interrupts for TX or RX DMA Channels prior to registering
their respective NAPI callbacks can result in a NULL pointer dereference.
This is seen in practice as a random occurrence since it depends on the
randomness associated with the generation of traffic by Linux and the
reception of traffic from the wire.

Il vise à garantir que les produits des technologies de l’information et de la communication tels que les composants technologiques, le matériel et les logiciels, répondent à des normes de sécurité strictes. Le but : renforcer la cybersécurité et garantir la cohérence des approches dans l’ensemble de l’Union européenne.</p>
<p>L’ANSSI est l’autorité nationale de certification de cybersécurité, à double titre. D’une part, l<strong>e Centre de certification national de l’ANSSI (CCN) est en charge de délivrer les certifications pour le niveau élevé du schéma EUCC</strong>. Au cours de l’année écoulée, les équipes de l’ANSSI et leurs partenaires se sont mis en ordre de bataille afin de pouvoir délivrer, sous les meilleurs délais, des certificats EUCC. D’autre part, <strong>la Mission Contrôles et Supervision de l’ANSSI instruit la procédure d’autorisation des organismes d’évaluation de la conformité</strong> nécessaire au préalable.</p>
<p>Le Centre de certification national a reçu l’accréditation du Cofrac le 28 mars dernier, puis l’autorisation de la Mission Contrôles et Supervision pour certifier les produits appartenant aux 3 domaines « Cartes à puce et dispositifs similaires », « Dispositifs matériels avec boîtiers de sécurité » et « Produits réseaux ou logiciels génériques »<sup>1</sup> . En parallèle, le centre d’évaluation de la sécurité (CESTI) Serma Safety & Security, avec lequel travaille CCN, a lui-même été accrédité et autorisé. <a href="https://certification.enisa.europa.eu/certificates_en"><strong>Deux certificats EUCC ont ainsi pu être émis par l’ANSSI</strong></a> le 31 mars 2025, suite à des évaluations conduites par Serma Safety & Security, pour les solutions des entreprises STMicroelectronics et Thales DIS France. Les certificats en question sont les premiers certificats EUCC à être publiés en Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Certificats EUCC : quelles modalités ?</strong></p>
<p>Depuis le 27 février 2025, tous les enregistrements de produits à évaluer selon les critères communs se font par une certification EUCC (hors cas spécifiques de défense et sécurité nationale).</p>
<p>Les certificats EUCC sont <strong>valables cinq ans</strong>, avec des conditions de maintien et de surveillance clairement définies dans le schéma. Ces dernières permettent de garantir la pérennité de la sécurité des solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Le formulaire de dossier d’évaluation est disponible </strong><a href="https://cyber.gouv.fr/documents-applicables-la-certification-criteres-communs-cc"><strong>ici</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Par ailleurs, les certificats EUCC ne remplacent pas le schéma <a href="https://cyber.gouv.fr/presentation-de-la-certification-de-securite-de-premier-niveau-cspn">CSPN</a> (certification de premier niveau) de l’ANSSI.</p>

      <title>CVE-2025-3153 - Concrete CMS Address Attribute Cross-Site Request Forgery and Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-3153
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 3, 2025, 2:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Concrete CMS version 9 below 9.4.0RC2 and versions below 8.5.20 are vulnerable to CSRF and XSS in the Concrete CMS Address attribute because addresses are not properly sanitized in the output when a country is not specified.  Attackers are limited to individuals whom a site administrator has granted the ability to fill in an address attribute. It is possible for the attacker to glean limited information from the site but amount and type is restricted by mitigating controls and the level of access of the attacker. Limited data modification is possible. The dashboard page itself could be rendered unavailable. 
The fix only sanitizes new data uploaded post update to Concrete CMS 9.4.0RC2. Existing database entries added before the update will still be “live” if there were successful exploits added under previous versions; a database search is recommended. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability CVSS v.4.0 score of 5.1  with vector CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L Thanks Myq Larson for reporting.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-27608
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Arduino IDE 2.x is an IDE based on the Theia IDE framework and built with Electron. A Self Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified within the Arduino-IDE prior to version v2.3.5. The vulnerability occurs in the Additional Board Manager URLs field, which can be found in the Preferences -> Settings section of the Arduino IDE interface. In the vulnerable versions, any values entered in this field are directly displayed to the user through a notification tooltip object, without a proper output encoding routine, due to the underlying ElectronJS engine interpretation. This vulnerability exposes the input parameter to Self-XSS attacks, which may lead to security risks depending on where the malicious payload is injected. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.5.

      <title>CVE-2025-30218 - Next.js Cross-Origin Request Exposure</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30218
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. To mitigate CVE-2025-29927, Next.js validated the x-middleware-subrequest-id which persisted across multiple incoming requests. However, this subrequest ID is sent to all requests, even if the destination is not the same host as the Next.js application. Initiating a fetch request to a third-party within Middleware will send the x-middleware-subrequest-id to that third party. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.6, 13.5.10, 14.2.26, and 15.2.4.

      <title>CVE-2025-31477 - Tauri Shell Plugin Remote Code Execution Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-31477
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>The Tauri shell plugin allows access to the system shell. Prior to 2.2.1, the Tauri shell plugin exposes functionality to execute code and open programs on the system. The open endpoint of this plugin is designed to allow open functionality with the system opener (e.g. xdg-open on Linux). This was meant to be restricted to a reasonable number of protocols like https or mailto by default. This default restriction was not functional due to improper validation of the allowed protocols, allowing for potentially dangerous protocols like file://, smb://, or nfs:// and others to be opened by the system registered protocol handler. By passing untrusted user input to the open endpoint these potentially dangerous protocols can be abused to gain remote code execution on the system. This either requires direct exposure of the endpoint to application users or code execution in the frontend of a Tauri application. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.1.

      <title>CVE-2025-31479 - GitHub Get-Workflow-Version-Action Token Truncation Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-31479
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>canonical/get-workflow-version-action is a GitHub composite action to get commit SHA that GitHub Actions reusable workflow was called with. Prior to 1.0.1, if the get-workflow-version-action step fails, the exception output may include the GITHUB_TOKEN. If the full token is included in the exception output, GitHub will automatically redact the secret from the GitHub Actions logs. However, the token may be truncated—causing part of the GITHUB_TOKEN to be displayed in plaintext in the GitHub Actions logs. Anyone with read access to the GitHub repository can view GitHub Actions logs. For public repositories, anyone can view the GitHub Actions logs. The opportunity to exploit this vulnerability is limited—the GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically revoked when the job completes. However, there is an opportunity for an attack in the time between the GITHUB_TOKEN being displayed in the logs and the completion of the job. Users using the github-token input are impacted. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.1.

<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 48 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>conda-forge infrastructure holds common configurations and settings for key pieces of the conda-forge infrastructure.
Between 2025-02-10 and 2025-04-01, conda-forge infrastructure used the wrong token for Azure's cf-staging access.

      <title>CVE-2025-21990 - AMDGPU NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21990
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 3 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: NULL-check BO's backing store when determining GFX12 PTE flags

PRT BOs may not have any backing store, so bo->tbo.resource will be
NULL. Check for that before dereferencing.

      <title>CVE-2025-21991 - AMD CPU Microcode Out-of-Bounds Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21991
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 3 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/microcode/AMD: Fix out-of-bounds on systems with CPU-less NUMA nodes

Currently, load_microcode_amd() iterates over all NUMA nodes, retrieves their
CPU masks and unconditionally accesses per-CPU data for the first CPU of each
mask.

According to Documentation/admin-guide/mm/numaperf.rst:

  "Some memory may share the same node as a CPU, and others are provided as
  memory only nodes."

Therefore, some node CPU masks may be empty and wouldn't have a "first CPU".

On a machine with far memory (and therefore CPU-less NUMA nodes):
- cpumask_of_node(nid) is 0
- cpumask_first(0) is CONFIG_NR_CPUS
- cpu_data(CONFIG_NR_CPUS) accesses the cpu_info per-CPU array at an
  index that is 1 out of bounds

This does not have any security implications since flashing microcode is
a privileged operation but I believe this has reliability implications by
potentially corrupting memory while flashing a microcode update.

When booting with CONFIG_UBSAN_BOUNDS=y on an AMD machine that flashes
a microcode update. I get the following splat:

  UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/microcode/amd.c:X:Y
  index 512 is out of range for type 'unsigned long[512]'
  [...]
  Call Trace:
   dump_stack
   __ubsan_handle_out_of_bounds
   load_microcode_amd
   request_microcode_amd
   reload_store
   kernfs_fop_write_iter
   vfs_write
   ksys_write
   do_syscall_64
   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe

Change the loop to go over only NUMA nodes which have CPUs before determining
whether the first CPU on the respective node needs microcode update.

      <title>CVE-2025-21992 - HP 5MP Camera HID Sensor Interface Denial of Service</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21992
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 3 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: ignore non-functional sensor in HP 5MP Camera

The HP 5MP Camera (USB ID 0408:5473) reports a HID sensor interface that
is not actually implemented. Attempting to access this non-functional
sensor via iio_info causes system hangs as runtime PM tries to wake up
an unresponsive sensor.

  [453] hid-sensor-hub 0003:0408:5473.0003: Report latency attributes: ffffffff:ffffffff
  [453] hid-sensor-hub 0003:0408:5473.0003: common attributes: 5:1, 2:1, 3:1 ffffffff:ffffffff

Add this device to the HID ignore list since the sensor interface is
non-functional by design and should not be exposed to userspace.

      <title>CVE-2025-21993 - IBM iSCSI IPv6 Subnet Mask Out-of-Bounds Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21993
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 1:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 3 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iscsi_ibft: Fix UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warning in ibft_attr_show_nic()

When performing an iSCSI boot using IPv6, iscsistart still reads the
/sys/firmware/ibft/ethernetX/subnet-mask entry. Since the IPv6 prefix
length is 64, this causes the shift exponent to become negative,
triggering a UBSAN warning. As the concept of a subnet mask does not
apply to IPv6, the value is set to ~0 to suppress the warning message.

      <title>CVE-2025-2842 - Tempo Operator ClusterRoleBinding Escalation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-2842
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 12:15 p.m. | 2 hours, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A flaw was found in the Tempo Operator. When the Jaeger UI Monitor Tab functionality is enabled in a Tempo instance managed by the Tempo Operator, the Operator creates a ClusterRoleBinding for the Service Account of the Tempo instance to grant the cluster-monitoring-view ClusterRole.
This can be exploited if a user has 'create' permissions on TempoStack and 'get' permissions on Secret in a namespace (for example, a user has ClusterAdmin permissions for a specific namespace), as the user can read the token of the Tempo service account and therefore has access to see all cluster metrics.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-2786
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 11:15 a.m. | 3 hours, 3 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A flaw was found in Tempo Operator, where it creates a ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, and ClusterRoleBinding when a user deploys a TempoStack or TempoMonolithic instance. This flaw allows a user with full access to their namespace to extract the ServiceAccount token and use it to submit TokenReview and SubjectAccessReview requests, potentially revealing information about other users' permissions. While this does not allow privilege escalation or impersonation, it exposes information that could aid in gathering information for further attacks.

      <title>CVE-2024-39780 - ROS dynparam YAML Deserialization Vulnerability (Arbitrary Code Execution)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2024-39780
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 2, 2025, 8:15 a.m. | 6 hours, 4 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>A YAML deserialization vulnerability was found in the Robot Operating System (ROS) 'dynparam', a command-line tool for getting, setting, and deleting parameters of a dynamically configurable node, affecting ROS distributions Noetic and earlier. The issue is caused by the use of the yaml.load() function in the 'set' and 'get' verbs, and allows for the creation of arbitrary Python objects. Through this flaw, a local or remote user can craft and execute arbitrary Python code. This issue has now been fixed for ROS Noetic via commit 3d93ac13603438323d7e9fa74e879e45c5fe2e8e.

      <title>CVE-2025-31135 - Go-Guerrilla SMTP Daemon Reverse Proxy IP Spoofing Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-31135
<br>
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 9 hours, 38 minutes ago
<br>
<strong>Description : </strong>Go-Guerrilla SMTP Daemon is a lightweight SMTP server written in Go. Prior to 1.6.7, when ProxyOn is enabled, the PROXY command will be accepted multiple times, with later invocations overriding earlier ones. The proxy protocol only supports one initial PROXY header; anything after that is considered part of the exchange between client and server, so the client is free to send further PROXY commands with whatever data it pleases. go-guerrilla will treat these as coming from the reverse proxy, allowing a client to spoof its IP address. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.7.

      <title>CVE-2025-30356 - "CryptoLib Heap Buffer Overflow Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-30356
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 10:15 p.m. | 5 hours, 37 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In 1.3.3 and earlier, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability persists in the Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity function due to an incomplete validation check on the fl (frame length) field. Although CVE-2025-29912 addressed an underflow issue involving fl, the patch fails to fully prevent unsafe calculations. As a result, an attacker can still craft malicious frames that cause a negative tf_payload_len, which is then interpreted as a large unsigned value, leading to a heap buffer overflow in a memcpy call.

<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix slab-use-after-free Read in l2cap_send_cmd

After the hci sync command releases l2cap_conn, the hci receive data work
queue references the released l2cap_conn when sending to the upper layer.
Add hci dev lock to the hci receive data work queue to synchronize the two.

      <title>CVE-2025-21970 - "mlx5 Bridge LAG State Check Crash"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21970
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Bridge, fix the crash caused by LAG state check

When removing LAG device from bridge, NETDEV_CHANGEUPPER event is
triggered. Driver finds the lower devices (PFs) to flush all the
offloaded entries. And mlx5_lag_is_shared_fdb is checked, it returns
false if one of PF is unloaded. In such case,
mlx5_esw_bridge_lag_rep_get() and its caller return NULL, instead of
the alive PF, and the flush is skipped.

Besides, the bridge fdb entry's lastuse is updated in mlx5 bridge
event handler. But this SWITCHDEV_FDB_ADD_TO_BRIDGE event can be
ignored in this case because the upper interface for bond is deleted,
and the entry will never be aged because lastuse is never updated.

To make things worse, as the entry is alive, mlx5 bridge workqueue
keeps sending that event, which is then handled by kernel bridge
notifier. It causes the following crash when accessing the passed bond
netdev which is already destroyed.

To fix this issue, remove such checks. LAG state is already checked in
commit 15f8f168952f ("net/mlx5: Bridge, verify LAG state when adding
bond to bridge"), driver still need to skip offload if LAG becomes
invalid state after initialization.

      <title>CVE-2025-21971 - "Linux Kernel net_sched TC_H_ROOT Class Creation Vulnerability"</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21971
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net_sched: Prevent creation of classes with TC_H_ROOT

The function qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() uses TC_H_ROOT as a termination
condition when traversing up the qdisc tree to update parent backlog
counters. However, if a class is created with classid TC_H_ROOT, the
traversal terminates prematurely at this class instead of reaching the
actual root qdisc, causing parent statistics to be incorrectly maintained.
In case of DRR, this could lead to a crash as reported by Mingi Cho.

Prevent the creation of any Qdisc class with classid TC_H_ROOT
(0xFFFFFFFF) across all qdisc types, as suggested by Jamal.

      <title>CVE-2025-21972 - Linux Kernel MCTP Net Fragment Reassembly Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21972
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mctp: unshare packets when reassembling

Ensure that the frag_list used for reassembly isn't shared with other
packets. This avoids incorrect reassembly when packets are cloned, and
prevents a memory leak due to circular references between fragments and
their skb_shared_info.

The upcoming MCTP-over-USB driver uses skb_clone which can trigger the
problem - other MCTP drivers don't share SKBs.

A kunit test is added to reproduce the issue.

      <title>CVE-2025-21973 - Here is the title:ASUS PRIME Z690-P D4 bnxt_en NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21973
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eth: bnxt: fix kernel panic in the bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx}

When qstats-get operation is executed, callbacks of netdev_stats_ops
are called. The bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx} collect per-queue stats
from sw_stats in the rings.
But {rx | tx | cp}_ring are allocated when the interface is up.
So, these rings are not allocated when the interface is down.

The qstats-get is allowed even if the interface is down. However,
the bnxt_get_queue_stats{rx | tx}() accesses cp_ring and tx_ring
without null check.
So, it needs to avoid accessing rings if the interface is down.

Reproducer:
 ip link set $interface down
 ./cli.py --spec netdev.yaml --dump qstats-get
OR
 ip link set $interface down
 python ./stats.py

      <title>CVE-2025-21974 - ASUS PRIME Z690-P D4 bnxt_en Use-After-Free Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21974
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eth: bnxt: return fail if interface is down in bnxt_queue_mem_alloc()

The bnxt_queue_mem_alloc() is called to allocate new queue memory when
a queue is restarted.
It internally accesses rx buffer descriptor corresponding to the index.
The rx buffer descriptor is allocated and set when the interface is up
and it's freed when the interface is down.
So, if queue is restarted if interface is down, kernel panic occurs.

<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: hyperv_fb: Allow graceful removal of framebuffer

When a Hyper-V framebuffer device is unbind, hyperv_fb driver tries to
release the framebuffer forcefully. If this framebuffer is in use it
produce the following WARN and hence this framebuffer is never released.

Fix this by moving the release of framebuffer and assosiated memory
to fb_ops.fb_destroy function, so that framebuffer framework handles
it gracefully.

While we fix this, also replace manual registrations/unregistration of
framebuffer with devm_register_framebuffer.

      <title>CVE-2025-21977 - Linux Hyper-V Framebuffer Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21977
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: hyperv_fb: Fix hang in kdump kernel when on Hyper-V Gen 2 VMs

Gen 2 Hyper-V VMs boot via EFI and have a standard EFI framebuffer
device. When the kdump kernel runs in such a VM, loading the efifb
driver may hang because of accessing the framebuffer at the wrong
memory address.

The scenario occurs when the hyperv_fb driver in the original kernel
moves the framebuffer to a different MMIO address because of conflicts
with an already-running efifb or simplefb driver. The hyperv_fb driver
then informs Hyper-V of the change, which is allowed by the Hyper-V FB
VMBus device protocol. However, when the kexec command loads the kdump
kernel into crash memory via the kexec_file_load() system call, the
system call doesn't know the framebuffer has moved, and it sets up the
kdump screen_info using the original framebuffer address. The transition
to the kdump kernel does not go through the Hyper-V host, so Hyper-V
does not reset the framebuffer address like it would do on a reboot.
When efifb tries to run, it accesses a non-existent framebuffer
address, which traps to the Hyper-V host. After many such accesses,
the Hyper-V host thinks the guest is being malicious, and throttles
the guest to the point that it runs very slowly or appears to have hung.

When the kdump kernel is loaded into crash memory via the kexec_load()
system call, the problem does not occur. In this case, the kexec command
builds the screen_info table itself in user space from data returned
by the FBIOGET_FSCREENINFO ioctl against /dev/fb0, which gives it the
new framebuffer location.

This problem was originally reported in 2020 [1], resulting in commit
3cb73bc3fa2a ("hyperv_fb: Update screen_info after removing old
framebuffer"). This commit solved the problem by setting orig_video_isVGA
to 0, so the kdump kernel was unaware of the EFI framebuffer. The efifb
driver did not try to load, and no hang occurred. But in 2024, commit
c25a19afb81c ("fbdev/hyperv_fb: Do not clear global screen_info")
effectively reverted 3cb73bc3fa2a. Commit c25a19afb81c has no reference
to 3cb73bc3fa2a, so perhaps it was done without knowing the implications
that were reported with 3cb73bc3fa2a. In any case, as of commit
c25a19afb81c, the original problem came back again.

Interestingly, the hyperv_drm driver does not have this problem because
it never moves the framebuffer. The difference is that the hyperv_drm
driver removes any conflicting framebuffers *before* allocating an MMIO
address, while the hyperv_fb drivers removes conflicting framebuffers
*after* allocating an MMIO address. With the "after" ordering, hyperv_fb
may encounter a conflict and move the framebuffer to a different MMIO
address. But the conflict is essentially bogus because it is removed
a few lines of code later.

Rather than fix the problem with the approach from 2020 in commit
3cb73bc3fa2a, instead slightly reorder the steps in hyperv_fb so
conflicting framebuffers are removed before allocating an MMIO address.
Then the default framebuffer MMIO address should always be available, and
there's never any confusion about which framebuffer address the kdump
kernel should use -- it's always the original address provided by
the Hyper-V host. This approach is already used by the hyperv_drm
driver, and is consistent with the usage guidelines at the head of
the module with the function aperture_remove_conflicting_devices().

This approach also solves a related minor problem when kexec_load()
is used to load the kdump kernel. With current code, unbinding and
rebinding the hyperv_fb driver could result in the framebuffer moving
back to the default framebuffer address, because on the rebind there
are no conflicts. If such a move is done after the kdump kernel is
loaded with the new framebuffer address, at kdump time it could again
have the wrong address.

This problem and fix are described in terms of the kdump kernel, but
it can also occur

      <title>CVE-2025-21978 - Hyper-V DRM Address Space Leak</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21978
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/hyperv: Fix address space leak when Hyper-V DRM device is removed

When a Hyper-V DRM device is probed, the driver allocates MMIO space for
the vram, and maps it cacheable. If the device removed, or in the error
path for device probing, the MMIO space is released but no unmap is done.
Consequently the kernel address space for the mapping is leaked.

Fix this by adding iounmap() calls in the device removal path, and in the
error path during device probing.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21979
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: cancel wiphy_work before freeing wiphy

A wiphy_work can be queued from the moment the wiphy is allocated and
initialized (i.e. wiphy_new_nm). When a wiphy_work is queued, the
rdev::wiphy_work is getting queued.

If wiphy_free is called before the rdev::wiphy_work had a chance to run,
the wiphy memory will be freed, and then when it eventally gets to run
it'll use invalid memory.

Fix this by canceling the work before freeing the wiphy.

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21980
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched: address a potential NULL pointer dereference in the GRED scheduler.

If kzalloc in gred_init returns a NULL pointer, the code follows the
error handling path, invoking gred_destroy. This, in turn, calls
gred_offload, where memset could receive a NULL pointer as input,
potentially leading to a kernel crash.

When table->opt is NULL in gred_init(), gred_change_table_def()
is not called yet, so it is not necessary to call ->ndo_setup_tc()
in gred_offload().

<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21981
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix memory leak in aRFS after reset

Fix aRFS (accelerated Receive Flow Steering) structures memory leak by
adding a checker to verify if aRFS memory is already allocated while
configuring VSI. aRFS objects are allocated in two cases:
- as part of VSI initialization (at probe), and
- as part of reset handling

However, VSI reconfiguration executed during reset involves memory
allocation one more time, without prior releasing already allocated
resources. This led to the memory leak with the following signature:

To address this switch to use of independent WQ_MEM_RECLAIM
workqueue, so the rules are not violated from workqueue framework
point of view.

Apart of that, since kvfree_rcu() does reclaim memory it is worth
to go with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM type of wq because it is designed for
this purpose.

      <title>CVE-2025-21984 - Linux Kernel mm Swapcache Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21984
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: fix kernel BUG when userfaultfd_move encounters swapcache

userfaultfd_move() checks whether the PTE entry is present or a
swap entry.

- If the PTE entry is present, move_present_pte() handles folio
  migration by setting:

  src_folio->index = linear_page_index(dst_vma, dst_addr);

- If the PTE entry is a swap entry, move_swap_pte() simply copies
  the PTE to the new dst_addr.

This approach is incorrect because, even if the PTE is a swap entry,
it can still reference a folio that remains in the swap cache.

This creates a race window between steps 2 and 4.
 1. add_to_swap: The folio is added to the swapcache.
 2. try_to_unmap: PTEs are converted to swap entries.
 3. pageout: The folio is written back.
 4. Swapcache is cleared.
If userfaultfd_move() occurs in the window between steps 2 and 4,
after the swap PTE has been moved to the destination, accessing the
destination triggers do_swap_page(), which may locate the folio in
the swapcache. However, since the folio's index has not been updated
to match the destination VMA, do_swap_page() will detect a mismatch.

This can result in two critical issues depending on the system
configuration.

If KSM is disabled, both small and large folios can trigger a BUG
during the add_rmap operation due to:

 page_pgoff(folio, page) != linear_page_index(vma, address)

      <title>CVE-2025-21985 - AMD Display Out-of-Bounds Array Index Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21985
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix out-of-bound accesses

[WHAT & HOW]
hpo_stream_to_link_encoder_mapping has size MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS(=4),
but location can have size up to 6. As a result, it is necessary to
check location against MAX_HPO_DP2_ENCODERS.

Similiarly, disp_cfg_stream_location can be used as an array index which
should be 0..5, so the ASSERT's conditions should be less without equal.

      <title>CVE-2025-21986 - Linux Kernel: Switchdev Notification Chain Locking Vulnerability</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>CVE ID : </strong>CVE-2025-21986
 
<strong>Published : </strong> April 1, 2025, 4:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 36 minutes ago
 
<strong>Description : </strong>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: switchdev: Convert blocking notification chain to a raw one

A blocking notification chain uses a read-write semaphore to protect the
integrity of the chain. The semaphore is acquired for writing when
adding / removing notifiers to / from the chain and acquired for reading
when traversing the chain and informing notifiers about an event.

In case of the blocking switchdev notification chain, recursive
notifications are possible which leads to the semaphore being acquired
twice for reading and to lockdep warnings being generated [1].

Specifically, this can happen when the bridge driver processes a
SWITCHDEV_BRPORT_UNOFFLOADED event which causes it to emit notifications
about deferred events when calling switchdev_deferred_process().

Fix this by converting the notification chain to a raw notification
chain in a similar fashion to the netdev notification chain. Protect
the chain using the RTNL mutex by acquiring it when modifying the chain.
Events are always informed under the RTNL mutex, but add an assertion in
call_switchdev_blocking_notifiers() to make sure this is not violated in
the future.

Maintain the "blocking" prefix as events are always emitted from process
context and listeners are allowed to block.

<p>L’activité de gestion de crise est nécessaire dans le cas de situations graves ou complexes, notamment par l’ampleur et les impacts de l’incident vis-à-vis des activités métiers du bénéficiaire et sur besoin capacitaire ou d’expertise relative à la gestion de crise. Elle peut aussi être essentielle si le bénéficiaire n’a pas effectué de préparation à la gestion de crise.</p>
<p><u>Ainsi, elle vise à</u> :</p>
<ul><li>apporter une assistance en situation de crise afin de limiter les impacts de l’incident.</li>
<li>limiter les impacts d’une crise cyber en apportant une capacité de réponse et de soutien adéquate afin de préserver les intérêts du bénéficiaire ou du commanditaire (réputation, continuité des activités, rétablissement des capacités opérationnelles, etc.).</li>
</ul><p><u>Sur proposition de cette version, les PRIS de gestion de crise seront capables notamment </u>:</p>
<ul><li>de contribuer à la mise en place d’un dispositif de gestion de crise en situation d’urgence ,</li>
<li>d’établir un plan d’action de gestion de crise, et d’assurer une cohérence d’ensemble de gestion de crise,</li>
<li>d’apporter un premier niveau de conseil à la communication de crise, et connaissances des enjeux cyber et juridiques.</li>
</ul><p><em><u>NB</u></em><em> : les PRIS ne se substitueront pas aux différents organes du bénéficiaire (juridique, communication, etc.), ni à leurs responsabilités.</em></p>
<p>Cette nouvelle activité est mise en ligne aujourd’hui dans le cadre d’un appel public à commentaires. Les observations, les commentaires et les propositions peuvent être transmis jusqu’au <strong>30 mai 2025</strong>, de préférence par courriel, à l’adresse <a href="mailto:commentaires-passipdispris@ssi.gouv.fr">commentaires-passipdispris@ssi.gouv.fr</a> et à l’aide de la fiche de lecture ci-dessous.</p>
<p>La possibilité de faciliter les évaluations des prestataires candidats à la fois à la qualification PACS sur l’activité de préparation à la gestion de crise et à la qualification PRIS sur l’activité de gestion de crise sera étudiée une fois les exigences relatives à la gestion de crise dans le référentiel PRIS finalisées.</p>
<p>Pour faciliter la relecture, l’ANSSI fournit le référentiel avec marques de révision.</p>
<p>L’ANSSI remercie par avance tous ceux qui répondront à cet appel à commentaires.</p>

<p><strong>Courant 2024, l’ANSSI a sous-traité à la société Quarkslab le développement de « fuzzysully », un <em>fuzzer</em> pour le protocole OPC UA</strong>. <strong>L’ANSSI publie ce jour cet outil <a href="https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/fuzzysully">sur le dépôt Github de l’Agence</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Cette publication s’inscrit dans <a href="https://cyber.gouv.fr/open-source-lanssi">la démarche générale de l’ANSSI</a> visant à partager avec la communauté cyber les codes qu’elle produit et à accroître le niveau de sécurité des logiciels open source. L’Agence assurera le maintien en conditions de sécurité (MCS) de <strong>fuzzysully</strong> mais ne prévoit pas de le faire évoluer.</p>
<p><strong>L’ANSSI invite l’écosystème cyber à s’approprier cet outil de manière à évaluer la robustesse de différentes implémentations du protocole OPC UA et ainsi à participer à l’amélioration de la sécurité des SI industriels.</strong> Pour toutes remarques ou questions : <u>industries [at] ssi.gouv.fr</u>.</p>

            <div class="field field--name-field-chapo field--type-string-long field--label-hidden field__item">Le panorama de la cybermenace 2024 dresse le bilan d’une année marquée par une pression désormais constante pesant tant sur l’écosystème national que sur les systèmes d’information les plus critiques. Pour faire face, l’ensemble des acteurs cyber français sont enjoints à maintenir leur mobilisation et leur vigilance de tous les instants.</div>
      
      <div class="field field--name-field-corps field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__items">
              <div class="field__item">  <div class="paragraph paragraph--type--op-texte-riche paragraph--view-mode--default">
    <div class="text-riche">
      
            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-texte-riche field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Au cours de l’année 2024, l’ANSSI a traité, avec différents niveaux de mobilisation, 4 386 événements de sécurité<sup>1</sup>, soit une augmentation de 15 % par rapport à l’année précédente. Ainsi, 3 004 signalements<sup>2</sup> et 1 361 incidents<sup>3</sup> ont été portés à la connaissance de l’Agence.</p>
<h3>Trois principales menaces : cybercriminels, attaquants réputés liés à la Russie et attaquants réputés liées à la Chine</h3>
<p>La menace portée par l’écosystème cybercriminel - principalement caractérisée par des attaques visant l’extorsion de rançons, <em>via</em> des fuites de données et des attaques par rançongiciel – s’est imposée comme un risque global et quotidien pour toutes les organisations françaises. Parmi les victimes de rançongiciels connues de l’ANSSI, les PME/TPE/ETI (37 %), les collectivités territoriales (17 %), ainsi que les établissements d’enseignement supérieur (12 %) et les entreprises stratégiques (12 %) ont été plus particulièrement touchés, avec des conséquences souvent très graves sur leur fonctionnement, leur réputation et leur continuité d’activité.</p>
<p>Une hausse des attaques à but de déstabilisation a également été observée, généralement menées par des groupes dits « hacktivistes » cherchant à attirer l’attention en mettant en œuvre des attaques de faible technicité mais à forte visibilité. Par exemple, les attaques par déni de service (DDoS) contre des cibles françaises ont doublé par rapport à 2023, avec une recrudescence pendant la période des Jeux. Malgré les conséquences limitées de ces dernières, le sabotage de petites installations industrielles a aussi été relevé. Ces attaques représentent une évolution vers une logique de sabotage, pour laquelle une vigilance s’impose.</p>
<p>À l’instar des années précédentes, ce sont les attaques à finalité d’espionnage qui ont le plus mobilisé les équipes opérationnelles de l’ANSSI. Les attaquants réputés liés aux intérêts stratégiques russes ont poursuivi leurs attaques guidées principalement par la recherche d’informations pouvant soutenir leurs efforts militaires ou diplomatiques. De son côté, l’activité associée aux modes opératoires réputés chinois a été particulièrement dense et répandue à des fins de captation de renseignements d’ordres stratégique et économique. Par ailleurs, le ciblage d’opérateurs de télécommunications s’est avéré intense et plusieurs incidents d’importance ont été traités par l’Agence.</p>
<h3>Mobilisation et vigilance des acteurs français : l'héritage indispensable des jeux</h3>
<p>L’année 2024 a été marquée par l’organisation des JOP, dont l’exposition médiatique et la surface d’attaque ont constitué des opportunités majeures pour les acteurs malveillants. Cependant, aucune de ces attaques n’a porté atteinte au déroulement de l’événement grâce à la bonne préparation et la grande mobilisation des équipes de l’ANSSI et de l’ensemble de l’écosystème cyber français.</p>
<p>Outre des opportunités conjoncturelles comme les Jeux, les attaquants se saisissent de toutes les faiblesses techniques exposées par les systèmes d’information (SI). Face à ce niveau de sécurité insuffisant, l’Agence enjoint les organisations à durcir et maintenir en condition de sécurité leurs SI afin de réduire la surface d’attaque. En particulier, au regard du nombre et de l’impact des vulnérabilités affectant les équipements de sécurité situés en bordure de SI – qui ont représenté plus de la moitié des opérations de cyberdéfense de l’ANSSI - l’Agence rappelle la nécessité urgente d’appliquer les correctifs de sécurité et ce le plus rapidement possible afin de se protéger d’exploitations opportunistes.</p>
<h3>L'ANSSI au c<strong>œ</strong>ur d'un collectif, pour une nation cyber-résiliente</h3>
<p>L’année écoulée a conforté l’Agence dans sa volonté de consolider un écosystème relai efficace. En effet, le renforcement des acteurs qui le composent, tels que les centres de réponse à incidents cyber (CSIRT) territoriaux, sectoriels ou ministériels, a déjà permis à l’ANSSI de concentrer son implication sur des attaques ayant des impacts plus critiques.</p>
<p>Face à l'ensemble de ces menaces, la France n'est pas désarmée : les travaux sur le volet cyber du projet de loi Résilience, visant à transporter la directive NIS 2 en France, constituent un pan essentiel de sa réponse. La démarche de co-construction choisie pour cette transposition a permis d'adapter au mieux le texte aux réalités et enjeux des entités afin d'en favoriser son appropriation et sa mise en œuvre</p>
<p>Enfin, il apparaît indispensable pour l’ANSSI de maintenir la pression sur l’écosystème cybercriminel en poursuivant sa coopération avec les autres services de l'État et les partenaires internationaux. Cette coopération a notamment permis de réaliser des opérations de démantèlement sur l’année écoulée.</p>

Cette menace est par ailleurs accentuée par une situation internationale de plus en plus conflictuelle, qui a des répercussions toujours plus significatives dans le cyberespace.</p>
<p>Depuis plusieurs années, la France et l’Union européenne (UE) travaillent à la prise en compte de ces paramètres au travers notamment de réseaux de coopération et de différents textes règlementaires (directive sur la sécurité des réseaux et des systèmes d’information (NIS 2), règlement sur la résilience cyber (CRA), etc.), qui participent tous à un objectif d’élévation générale de la cybersécurité de l’UE et de ses Etats membres.</p>
<p>La réussite des Jeux olympiques et paralympiques de Paris 2024 (JOP) a été l’aboutissement d’un travail intense durant deux ans des agents de l’ANSSI et de « l’équipe de France » de la cybersécurité dans son ensemble. Au-delà des enseignements qui ont déjà été tirés sur le travail de préparation, d’entrainement et d’articulation avec l’écosystème, y compris international, cette réussite des JOP est venue consacrer un modèle français de la cybersécurité qui repose sur une séparation claire, au sein de l’État, entre les missions défensives et offensives, l’Agence étant chargée de coordonner le champ de la défense et de la protection des systèmes d’information.</p>
<p>Forte de ces constats, prenant acte des évolutions du paysage cyber et s’appuyant sur la compétence, l’ouverture et l’agilité qui constituent ses trois valeurs centrales, l’ANSSI a rédigé un nouveau plan stratégique cinq ans après le Manifeste, dernier document stratégique publié par l’Agence à l’occasion de ses 10 ans. Dans le cadre posé par la stratégie nationale de cybersécurité, ce plan a vocation à guider l’ANSSI au cours des prochaines années dans une logique de co-construction avec l’ensemble des parties prenantes et en permettant au collectif national des acteurs de la cybersécurité d’amplifier leurs actions et leur impact.</p>
<p>Il est construit autour de 4 axes :</p>
<ul><li>Amplifier et coordonner la réponse cyber face à la massification de la menace</li>
<li>Développer les expertises indispensables pour contrer les menaces cyber</li>
<li>Promouvoir une action cyber européenne et internationale efficace</li>
<li>Renforcer la prise en compte des enjeux sociétaux dans l’action de l’ANSSI</li>
</ul><p>Avec ce plan, l’ANSSI s’inscrit plus que jamais « au cœur d’un collectif, pour une nation cyber-résiliente ».</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-texte-riche field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Le <em>cloud computing</em> est devenu partie intégrante de nos usages numériques notamment parce que cette technologie offre de nombreux avantages, mais il est nécessaire de connaître les menaces et de mesurer les risques qui accompagnent son utilisation. Pour ce faire, l’ANSSI met à disposition son état de la menace sur le <em>cloud </em>et partage ses<em> </em>recommandations de sécurité pour y faire face.</p>
<h3>L’ environnement <em>cloud,</em> une cible grandissante des cyberattaques</h3>
<p>Les environnements<em> cloud </em>sont de plus en plus la cible d’attaquants cherchant à compromettre l’intégrité de ces systèmes. Cela s’explique notamment par l’intérêt pour les données traitées par les fournisseurs de service cloud, mais également parce qu’ils offrent une entrée potentielle vers les organisations qui utilisent ces services.</p>
<p>Le ciblage d’environnement cloud fait désormais partie intégrante du mode opératoire des attaquants qui ont développé des compétences bien spécifiques et poursuivent des finalités lucratives, d’espionnage, et ou de déstabilisation. Cette maîtrise grandissante de ces environnements cloud entraîne l’accroissement des tentatives de latéralisation depuis des environnements on-premise compromis vers le cloud et réciproquement.</p>
<p>Les vulnérabilités dans des équipements de bordure (tels que des VPN) sont notamment devenues des points d’entrée privilégiés pour les attaquants. Ils exploitent également les mauvaises configurations et les défauts de sécurisation (permissions excessives, applications obsolètes).</p>
<h3>L’utilisation du<em> cloud</em> pose de nouveaux défis en matière de sécurité informatique</h3>
<p>Une tendance grandissante identifiée par l’ANSSI dans son rapport est l’utilisation des services de <em>cloud</em> comme infrastructures d’attaques. Les acteurs malveillants utilisent désormais des services <em>cloud</em> à des fins malveillantes, dans le but de stocker, des codes malveillants ou des données volées sur des plateformes grand public. Il devient alors très complexe de détecter les activités malveillantes en les dissimulant au sein du trafic légitime des utilisateurs de ces plateformes.</p>
<p>Les enjeux de sécurité qui accompagnent l’utilisation du <em>cloud</em> imposent de s’interroger sur les responsabilités qui incombent aussi bien aux fournisseurs de services<em> cloud</em> qu’aux utilisateurs de ces plateformes. L’ANSSI fait le constat que de nombreux incidents de sécurité sont<s> </s>dus à une faiblesse dans le cloisonnement entre les systèmes d’information en partie liée à l’usage du <em>cloud</em> ou aux manquements dans la supervision des systèmes d’information.</p>

<p>Dans son état de la menace, l’ANSSI partage ses recommandations, aussi bien pour les fournisseurs de cloud que pour les clients, qui visent à mettre en place des mesures de sécurité claires et des bonnes pratiques.</p>
<p>L’hébergement de certaines données dans le cloud nécessitent de réaliser une analyse de risques afin de déterminer l’offre adaptée. Pour accompagner les entités publiques et privées, l’ANSSI met à disposition :</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://cyber.gouv.fr/recourir-des-solutions-cloud">ses recommandations sur l’hébergement des systèmes d’informations sensibles dans le cloud</a><u>.</u> Cette série de recommandations précisent, en fonction du type de SI, de la sensibilité des données et du niveau de la menace, les types d’offres cloud à privilégier.</li>
</ul><p>L’ANSSI recommande de privilégier des offres cloisonnées entre clients de type SecNumCloud pour des activités sensibles. <a href="https://cyber.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/document/secnumcloud-referentiel-exigences-v3.2.pdf">Le référentiel SecNumCloud</a> propose un ensemble de règles de sécurité à suivre garantissant un haut niveau d’exigence tant du point de vue technique, qu’opérationnel ou juridique.</p>
<p>Enfin, le recours au cloud impose la prise en compte de l’évolution des capacités de supervision afin de se prémunir contre les menaces abordées dans le document.</p>

<p>En tant qu’autorité nationale en matière de cyberdéfense et de cybersécurité, l’ANSSI a travaillé à l’identification et la bonne compréhension des risques cyber des systèmes d’intelligence artificielle (SIA), en collaboration avec ses partenaires nationaux et internationaux, également réunis à Paris à l’occasion du Sommet pour l’action sur l’IA.</p>
<p><strong>Des systèmes d’information qui posent de nouveaux défis à la cybersécurité</strong></p>
<p>Dans les travaux qu’elle a menés, l’ANSSI souligne en premier lieu que les systèmes intégrant une IA (SIA) demeurent fondamentalement des systèmes logiciels, soumis en tout état de cause aux mêmes vulnérabilités que des systèmes plus classiques, comme le détournement de comptes utilisateurs ou administrateurs ou l’exploitation de vulnérabilités dans les composants logiciels intégrés dans le système. Les scénarios de cyberattaque classiques restent ainsi aujourd’hui les plus crédibles contre de tels SIA. Le respect des bonnes pratiques de cybersécurité applicables à tout système d’information, est ainsi un enjeu primordial pour la mise en œuvre d’une IA de confiance.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em> </em></strong><em>« Le temps fort qu’a constitué le Sommet pour l’action sur l’IA a démontré la nécessité de mieux faire travailler ensemble les experts de l’IA et ceux de la cybersécurité afin d’objectiver les risques et opportunités, loin des marchands de peur et des marchands de rêves.», </em>précise Vincent Strubel, directeur général de l’ANSSI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>L’ANSSI s’implique dans le développement d’une IA de confiance qui bénéficie à tous</strong></p>
<p>Afin d’accompagner le développement d’une IA de confiance qui bénéficie à tous et pour tous les usages, quelle que soit leur criticité, l’ANSSI promeut une approche par les risques.</p>
<p>Pour guider notamment les dirigeants et les producteurs de solutions d’IA, plusieurs livrables ont été dévoilés à l’occasion du Sommet :</p>
<ul><li>Le document de référence <a href="https://cyber.gouv.fr/en/publications/building-trust-ai-through-cyber-risk-based-approach">« <em>Building trust in AI through a cyber risk approach</em> »</a> : co-signé par de 19 partenaires internationaux et 5 partenaires nationaux a été présenté le 7 février lors des journées scientifiques organisées par l’Institut Polytechnique de Paris. Il met en évidence les risques cyber auxquels sont exposés les systèmes d’IA et relaie les principales recommandations stratégiques afin de favoriser une meilleure prise en compte de la cybersécurité dans le développement et l’intégration de ces systèmes. Cette analyse de risque a été élaborée suite aux consultations de plusieurs entités publiques et privées matures sur le sujet de l’IA, afin de s’assurer de toujours conserver un ancrage des travaux dans le réel. <em><a href="https://cyber.gouv.fr/publications/developper-la-confiance-dans-lia-par-une-approche-par-les-risques-cyber">Un document également disponible en français</a>.</em></li>
<li>L’exercice de crise cyber, organisé par l’ANSSI le 11 février au Campus Cyber, a mobilisé près de 200 participants experts cyber et experts IA dans l’objectif de développer une meilleure compréhension mutuelle de leurs attentes. Alors que le scénario proposé comprenait une cyberattaque affectant un SIA et sa chaine d’approvisionnement (supply chain), les participants ont pu échanger des bonnes pratiques tout en étant sensibilisés aux risques cyber. Des axes d’amélioration en matière de gestion de crise cyber ont notamment été identifiés lors de l’exercice et un retour d’expérience sera prochainement organisé.</li>
<li>La rencontre des directeurs d’agences cyber partenaires s’est déroulée en parallèle du Sommet. L’ANSSI et ses partenaires internationaux ont pu contribuer activement aux débats en cours sur la sécurisation de l’IA. Tous sont pleinement engagés dans le traitement, à l’échelle internationale, de ces questions, tout en veillant à explorer les modalités d’articulation et de coopération internationale en la matière. </li>

Julien Devevey, cryptologue du Laboratoire de Cryptographie de l’ANSSI, a participé à la conception de l’algorithme HAETAE qui a remporté cette compétition le 16 janvier 2025.</div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-texte-riche field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>La compétition coréenne, qui a débuté en 2022, visait la sélection et de la standardisation d'algorithmes post-quantiques KpqC qui opposait 16 algorithmes candidats. La cryptographie post quantique est l’ensemble des algorithmes cryptographiques [à clé publique] conçus pour résister non seulement aux attaques des ordinateurs actuels mais également aux attaques d’ordinateurs quantiques de très grande capacité. Les algorithmes post-quantiques peuvent être implémentés sur les ordinateurs actuels.</p>
<p>Parmi les 8 candidats qui restaient en lice au terme d'une présélection réalisée en 2023, la compétition a abouti à une sélection finale de 4 algorithmes le 16 janvier 2025.</p>
<p>Parmi les deux schémas de signature post-quantique sélectionnés figure HAETAE, fruit d'une coopération entre des équipes françaises, coréennes et allemandes. HAETAE, dont Julien Devevey, cryptologue à l'ANSSI est l'un des concepteurs, est fondé, de même que le standard NIST ML-DSA, sur la difficulté conjecturée du problème de réseaux euclidiens Module-LWE et sur une variante dite avec rejets du paradigme de Fiat-Shamir. Mais il est plus compact que ML-DSA : à niveau de sécurité égal, son intégration dans certains protocoles de l'internet nécessite de ce fait moins de fragmentation.</p>
<p>Les trois autres algorithmes de la sélection finale de la compétition KpqC sont un autre schéma de signature, AIMer, et deux schémas de chiffrement et d'établissement de clé, NTRU+ et SMAUG-T.</p>
