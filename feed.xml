      <description>[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

atm/fore200e Fix possible data race in fore200e_open()

Protect access to fore200e->available_cell_rate with rate_mtx lock in the
error handling path of fore200e_open() to prevent a data race.

The field fore200e->available_cell_rate is a shared resource used to track
available bandwidth. It is concurrently accessed by fore200e_open(),
fore200e_close(), and fore200e_change_qos().

In fore200e_open(), the lock rate_mtx is correctly held when subtracting
vcc->qos.txtp.max_pcr from available_cell_rate to reserve bandwidth.
However, if the subsequent call to fore200e_activate_vcin() fails, the
function restores the reserved bandwidth by adding back to
available_cell_rate without holding the lock.

This introduces a race condition because available_cell_rate is a global
device resource shared across all VCCs. If the error path in
fore200e_open() executes concurrently with operations like
fore200e_close() or fore200e_change_qos() on other VCCs, a
read-modify-write race occurs.

Specifically, the error path reads the rate without the lock. If another
CPU acquires the lock and modifies the rate (e.g., releasing bandwidth in
fore200e_close()) between this read and the subsequent write, the error
path will overwrite the concurrent update with a stale value. This results
in incorrect bandwidth accounting. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>

      <description>[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

team Move team device type change at the end of team_port_add

Attempting to add a port device that is already up will expectedly fail,
but not before modifying the team device header_ops.

In the case of the syzbot reproducer the gre0 device is
already in state UP when it attempts to add it as a
port device of team0, this fails but before that
header_ops->create of team0 is changed from eth_header to ipgre_header
in the call to team_dev_type_check_change.

Later when we end up in ipgre_header() struct ip_tunnel* points to nonsense
as the private data of the device still holds a struct team.

Example sequence of iproute2 commands to reproduce the hang/BUG()
ip link add dev team0 type team
ip link add dev gre0 type gre
ip link set dev gre0 up
ip link set dev gre0 master team0
ip link set dev team0 up
ping -I team0 1.1.1.1

Move team_dev_type_check_change down where all other checks have passed
as it changes the dev type with no way to restore it in case
one of the checks that follow it fail.

Also make sure to preserve the origial mtu assignment
  - If port_dev is not the same type as dev, dev takes mtu from port_dev
  - If port_dev is the same type as dev, port_dev takes mtu from dev

This is done by adding a conditional before the call to dev_set_mtu
to prevent it from assigning port_dev->mtu = dev->mtu and instead
letting team_dev_type_check_change assign dev->mtu = port_dev->mtu.
The conditional is needed because the patch moves the call to
team_dev_type_check_change past dev_set_mtu.

Testing
  - team device driver in-tree selftests
  - Add/remove various devices as slaves of team device

veth reduce XDP no_direct retu...</title>
      <description>[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

veth reduce XDP no_direct return section to fix race

As explain in commit fa349e396e48 ("veth Fix race with AF_XDP exposing
old or uninitialized descriptors") for veth there is a chance after
napi_complete_done() that another CPU can manage start another NAPI
instance running veth_pool(). For NAPI this is correctly handled as the
napi_schedule_prep() check will prevent multiple instances from getting
scheduled, but for the remaining code in veth_pool() this can run
concurrent with the newly started NAPI instance.

The problem/race is that xdp_clear_return_frame_no_direct() isn't
designed to be nested.

Prior to commit 401cb7dae813 ("net Reference bpf_redirect_info via
task_struct on PREEMPT_RT.") the temporary BPF net context
bpf_redirect_info was stored per CPU, where this wasn't an issue. Since
this commit the BPF context is stored in 'current' task_struct. When
running veth in threaded-NAPI mode, then the kthread becomes the storage
area. Now a race exists between two concurrent veth_pool() function calls
one exiting NAPI and one running new NAPI, both using the same BPF net
context.

Race is when another CPU gets within the xdp_set_return_frame_no_direct()
section before exiting veth_pool() calls the clear-function
xdp_clear_return_frame_no_direct(). | Severity UNKNOWN</description>

In versions from 1.3.0 to before 1.3.9, the download service (download_service.py) makes HTTP requests using raw requests.get() without utilizing the application's SSRF protection (safe_requests.py). This can allow attackers to access internal services and attempt to reach cloud provider metadata endpoints (AWS/GCP/Azure), as well as perform internal network reconnaissance, by submitting malicious URLs through the API, depending on the deployment and surrounding controls. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.9. | CVSS Score 6.3 (MEDIUM)                                                          </description>

The issue occurs because usbhs_sys_function_pullup(), which accesses the IP
registers, is executed after the USBHS clocks have been disabled. The
problem is reproducible on the Renesas RZ/G3S SoC starting with the
addition of module stop in the clock enable/disable APIs. With module stop
functionality enabled, a bus error is expected if a master accesses a
module whose clock has been stopped and module stop activated.

Disable the IP clocks at the end of remove. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>

tracing Fix WARN_ON in tracing_buffers_mmap_close for split VMAs

When a VMA is split (e.g., by partial munmap or MAP_FIXED), the kernel

results in ring_buffer_unmap() being called multiple times while
ring_buffer_map() was only called once.

This causes ring_buffer_unmap() to return -ENODEV on subsequent calls
because user_mapped is already 0, triggering a WARN_ON.

Trace buffer mappings cannot support partial mappings because the ring
buffer structure requires the complete buffer including the meta page.

VMA splits entirely. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>

      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

usb uas fix urb unmapping issue when the uas device is remove during ongoing data transfer

When a UAS device is unplugged during data transfer, there is
a probability of a system panic occurring. The root cause is
an access to an invalid memory address during URB callback handling.
Specifically, this happens when the dma_direct_unmap_sg() function
is called within the usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() interface, but the
sg->dma_address field is 0 and the sg data structure has already been
freed.

The SCSI driver sends transfer commands by invoking uas_queuecommand_lck()
in uas.c, using the uas_submit_urbs() function to submit requests to USB.
Within the uas_submit_urbs() implementation, three URBs (sense_urb,
data_urb, and cmd_urb) are sequentially submitted. Device removal may
occur at any point during uas_submit_urbs execution, which may result
in URB submission failure. However, some URBs might have been successfully
submitted before the failure, and uas_submit_urbs will return the -ENODEV
error code in this case. The current error handling directly calls
scsi_done(). In the SCSI driver, this eventually triggers scsi_complete()
to invoke scsi_end_request() for releasing the sgtable. The successfully
submitted URBs, when being unlinked to giveback, call
usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() in hcd.c, leading to exceptions during sg
unmapping operations since the sg data structure has already been freed.

This patch modifies the error condition check in the uas_submit_urbs()
function. When a UAS device is removed but one or more URBs have already
been successfully submitted to USB, it avoids immediately invoking
scsi_done() and save the cmnd to devinfo->cmnd array. If the successfully
submitted URBs is completed before devinfo->resetting being set, then
the scsi_done() function will be called within uas_try_complete() after
all pending URB operations are finalized. Otherwise, the scsi_done()
function will be called within uas_zap_pending(), which is executed after
usb_kill_anchored_urbs().

The error handling only takes effect when uas_queuecommand_lck() calls
uas_submit_urbs() and returns the error value -ENODEV . In this case,
the device is disconnected, and the flow proceeds to uas_disconnect(),
where uas_zap_pending() is invoked to call uas_try_complete(). | Severity UNKNOWN</description>

comedi c6xdigio Fix invalid P...</title>
      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

comedi c6xdigio Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration

The Comedi low-level driver "c6xdigio" seems to be for a parallel port
connected device.  When the Comedi core calls the driver's Comedi
"attach" handler `c6xdigio_attach()` to configure a Comedi to use this
driver, it tries to enable the parallel port PNP resources by
registering a PNP driver with `pnp_register_driver()`, but ignores the
return value.  (The `struct pnp_driver` it uses has only the `name` and
`id_table` members filled in.)  The driver's Comedi "detach" handler
`c6xdigio_detach()` unconditionally unregisters the PNP driver with
`pnp_unregister_driver()`.

It is possible for `c6xdigio_attach()` to return an error before it
calls `pnp_register_driver()` and it is possible for the call to
`pnp_register_driver()` to return an error (that is ignored).  In both
cases, the driver should not be calling `pnp_unregister_driver()` as it
does in `c6xdigio_detach()`.  (Note that `c6xdigio_detach()` will be
called by the Comedi core if `c6xdigio_attach()` returns an error, or if
the Comedi core decides to detach the Comedi device from the driver for
some other reason.)

The unconditional call to `pnp_unregister_driver()` without a previous
successful call to `pnp_register_driver()` will cause
`driver_unregister()` to issue a warning "Unexpected driver
unregister!".  This was detected by Syzbot [1].

Also, the PNP driver registration and unregistration should be done at
module init and exit time, respectively, not when attaching or detaching
Comedi devices to the driver.  (There might be more than one Comedi
device being attached to the driver, although that is unlikely.)

Change the driver to do the PNP driver registration at module init time,
and the unregistration at module exit time.  Since `c6xdigio_detach()`
now only calls `comedi_legacy_detach()`, remove the function and change
the Comedi driver "detach" handler to `comedi_legacy_detach`.

platform/x86/amd/pmc Add support for Van Gogh SoC

The ROG Xbox Ally (non-X) SoC features a similar architecture to the
Steam Deck. While the Steam Deck supports S3 (s2idle causes a crash),
this support was dropped by the Xbox Ally which only S0ix suspend.

Since the handler is missing here, this causes the device to not suspend
and the AMD GPU driver to crash while trying to resume afterwards due to
a power hang. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>

      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved

comedi pcl818 fix null-ptr-deref in pcl818_ai_cancel()

Syzbot identified an issue [1] in pcl818_ai_cancel(), which stems from
the fact that in case of early device detach via pcl818_detach(),
subdevice dev->read_subdev may not have initialized its pointer to
struct comedi_async as intended. Thus, any such dereferencing of
s->async->cmd will lead to general protection fault and kernel crash.

Mitigate this problem by removing a call to pcl818_ai_cancel() from
pcl818_detach() altogether. This way, if the subdevice setups its
support for async commands, everything async-related will be
handled via subdevice's own ->cancel() function in
comedi_device_detach_locked() even before pcl818_detach(). If no
support for asynchronous commands is provided, there is no need
to cancel anything either.

The above issue occurs with us in errors=continue mode when accompanied by
storage failures. There have been many inconsistencies in the file system
data.
In the case of file system data inconsistency, for example, if the block
bitmap of a referenced block is not set, it can lead to the situation where
a block being committed is allocated and used again. As a result, the
following condition will not be satisfied then trigger BUG_ON. Of course,
it is entirely possible to construct a problematic image that can trigger
this BUG_ON through specific operations. In fact, I have constructed such
an image and easily reproduced this issue.
Therefore, J_ASSERT() holds true only under ideal conditions, but it may
not necessarily be satisfied in exceptional scenarios. Using J_ASSERT()
directly in abnormal situations would cause the system to crash, which is
clearly not what we want. So here we directly trigger a JBD abort instead
of immediately invoking BUG_ON. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>

Static object `COdaMfcAppApp theApp` may access `OdStringkEmpty` before its initialization. Due to undefined initialization order of static objects across translation units (Static Initialization Order Fiasco), the application accesses uninitialized memory.

The client communicates user-controlled file paths to a privileged service, which performs file system operations without impersonating the requesting user. Due to improper privilege handling and a time-of-check time-of-use race condition combined with symbolic link and mount point manipulation, a local authenticated attacker can coerce the service into deleting arbitrary directories with SYSTEM privileges. This can be exploited to delete protected system folders such as C\\Config.msi and subsequently achieve execution as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM via MSI rollback techniques. | Severity UNKNOWN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </description>
