### Usage

As the Node.js organization continues to grow and expand, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of all the ongoing projects, teams, and working groups. We've recognized this challenge and have been actively seeking solutions to improve communication and awareness within our community.

This feed was established with the intention of offering support for news sites, blogs, and other creators that aim to deliver timely updates on Node.js news, releases, and other content relevant to the Node.js community.


#### Consume the feed
The RSS feed is available at https://nodejs.github.io/nodejs-news-feeder/feed.xml, optionally you can subscribe to the Slack channel `#nodejs-news-feeder` to receive the latest news.

#### Use your terminal to read the latest news
You can also read the latest news directly from your terminal using the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://nodejs.github.io/nodejs-news-feeder/feed.xml | grep -E '(<title>|<link>|<pubDate>)' | sed 's/<[^>]*>//g' | sed 's/^[ \t]*//;s/[ \t]*$//'
```

#### Read the news on your browser

You can also read the latest news on your browser using the following link: [https://nodejs.github.io/nodejs-news-feeder/](https://nodejs.github.io/nodejs-news-feeder/)

In order to update the RSS feed, you need to trigger the Github Action `Populate Feed` [manually](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-news-feeder/actions/workflows/populate_feed.yml) or wait for the CRON job.

This process will generate a PR with the latest news, so we can change the content and decide when to merge it.

### How it works

![architecture overview](https://blog.ulisesgascon.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimg%2Farch-nodejs-news-feeder.png&w=1920&q=75)

1. The community creates releases and also generates content by replying to specific issues and discussions.
2. A GitHub Action, triggered by a cron job or manual input, collects issues/releases/discussions, processes, formats, validates, and stores all the new information as feed items.
3. The changes are then presented in a pull request, which is thoroughly reviewed by curators who ensure that the content meet our expectations, before is publicly available and promoted.
4. Once the changes are approved and included in the main branch, the updated content can be accessed by readers via a feed or a specific channel on Slack.
