It is concurrently accessed by fore200e_open(),\r\nfore200e_close(), and fore200e_change_qos().\r\n\r\nIn fore200e_open(), the lock rate_mtx is correctly held when subtracting\r\nvcc->qos.txtp.max_pcr from available_cell_rate to reserve bandwidth.\r\nHowever, if the subsequent call to fore200e_activate_vcin() fails, the\r\nfunction restores the reserved bandwidth by adding back to\r\navailable_cell_rate without holding the lock.\r\n\r\nThis introduces a race condition because available_cell_rate is a global\r\ndevice resource shared across all VCCs. If the error path in\r\nfore200e_open() executes concurrently with operations like\r\nfore200e_close() or fore200e_change_qos() on other VCCs, a\r\nread-modify-write race occurs.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the error path reads the rate without the lock. If another\r\nCPU acquires the lock and modifies the rate (e.g., releasing bandwidth in\r\nfore200e_close()) between this read and the subsequent write, the error\r\npath will overwrite the concurrent update with a stale value. This results\r\nin incorrect bandwidth accounting. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68339</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-68339</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2025-68340 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nteam Move team device type cha...</title>\r\n      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nteam Move team device type change at the end of team_port_add\r\n\r\nAttempting to add a port device that is already up will expectedly fail,\r\nbut not before modifying the team device header_ops.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the syzbot reproducer the gre0 device is\r\nalready in state UP when it attempts to add it as a\r\nport device of team0, this fails but before that\r\nheader_ops->create of team0 is changed from eth_header to ipgre_header\r\nin the call to team_dev_type_check_change.\r\n\r\nLater when we end up in ipgre_header() struct ip_tunnel* points to nonsense\r\nas the private data of the device still holds a struct team.\r\n\r\nExample sequence of iproute2 commands to reproduce the hang/BUG()\r\nip link add dev team0 type team\r\nip link add dev gre0 type gre\r\nip link set dev gre0 up\r\nip link set dev gre0 master team0\r\nip link set dev team0 up\r\nping -I team0 1.1.1.1\r\n\r\nMove team_dev_type_check_change down where all other checks have passed\r\nas it changes the dev type with no way to restore it in case\r\none of the checks that follow it fail.\r\n\r\nAlso make sure to preserve the origial mtu assignment\r\n  - If port_dev is not the same type as dev, dev takes mtu from port_dev\r\n  - If port_dev is the same type as dev, port_dev takes mtu from dev\r\n\r\nThis is done by adding a conditional before the call to dev_set_mtu\r\nto prevent it from assigning port_dev->mtu = dev->mtu and instead\r\nletting team_dev_type_check_change assign dev->mtu = port_dev->mtu.\r\nThe conditional is needed because the patch moves the call to\r\nteam_dev_type_check_change past dev_set_mtu.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n  - team device driver in-tree selftests\r\n  - Add/remove various devices as slaves of team device\r\n  - syzbot | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68340</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-68340</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2025-68341 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nveth reduce XDP no_direct retu...</title>\r\n      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nveth reduce XDP no_direct return section to fix race\r\n\r\nAs explain in commit fa349e396e48 (\"veth Fix race with AF_XDP exposing\r\nold or uninitialized descriptors\") for veth there is a chance after\r\nnapi_complete_done() that another CPU can manage start another NAPI\r\ninstance running veth_pool().

The root cause is\r\nan access to an invalid memory address during URB callback handling.\r\nSpecifically, this happens when the dma_direct_unmap_sg() function\r\nis called within the usb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() interface, but the\r\nsg->dma_address field is 0 and the sg data structure has already been\r\nfreed.\r\n\r\nThe SCSI driver sends transfer commands by invoking uas_queuecommand_lck()\r\nin uas.c, using the uas_submit_urbs() function to submit requests to USB.\r\nWithin the uas_submit_urbs() implementation, three URBs (sense_urb,\r\ndata_urb, and cmd_urb) are sequentially submitted. Device removal may\r\noccur at any point during uas_submit_urbs execution, which may result\r\nin URB submission failure. However, some URBs might have been successfully\r\nsubmitted before the failure, and uas_submit_urbs will return the -ENODEV\r\nerror code in this case. The current error handling directly calls\r\nscsi_done(). In the SCSI driver, this eventually triggers scsi_complete()\r\nto invoke scsi_end_request() for releasing the sgtable. The successfully\r\nsubmitted URBs, when being unlinked to giveback, call\r\nusb_hcd_unmap_urb_for_dma() in hcd.c, leading to exceptions during sg\r\nunmapping operations since the sg data structure has already been freed.\r\n\r\nThis patch modifies the error condition check in the uas_submit_urbs()\r\nfunction. When a UAS device is removed but one or more URBs have already\r\nbeen successfully submitted to USB, it avoids immediately invoking\r\nscsi_done() and save the cmnd to devinfo->cmnd array. If the successfully\r\nsubmitted URBs is completed before devinfo->resetting being set, then\r\nthe scsi_done() function will be called within uas_try_complete() after\r\nall pending URB operations are finalized. Otherwise, the scsi_done()\r\nfunction will be called within uas_zap_pending(), which is executed after\r\nusb_kill_anchored_urbs().\r\n\r\nThe error handling only takes effect when uas_queuecommand_lck() calls\r\nuas_submit_urbs() and returns the error value -ENODEV . In this case,\r\nthe device is disconnected, and the flow proceeds to uas_disconnect(),\r\nwhere uas_zap_pending() is invoked to call uas_try_complete(). | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 17:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68331</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-68331</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2025-68332 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\ncomedi c6xdigio Fix invalid P...</title>\r\n      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\ncomedi c6xdigio Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration\r\n\r\nThe Comedi low-level driver \"c6xdigio\" seems to be for a parallel port\r\nconnected device.  When the Comedi core calls the driver's Comedi\r\n\"attach\" handler `c6xdigio_attach()` to configure a Comedi to use this\r\ndriver, it tries to enable the parallel port PNP resources by\r\nregistering a PNP driver with `pnp_register_driver()`, but ignores the\r\nreturn value.  (The `struct pnp_driver` it uses has only the `name` and\r\n`id_table` members filled in.)  The driver's Comedi \"detach\" handler\r\n`c6xdigio_detach()` unconditionally unregisters the PNP driver with\r\n`pnp_unregister_driver()`.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for `c6xdigio_attach()` to return an error before it\r\ncalls `pnp_register_driver()` and it is possible for the call to\r\n`pnp_register_driver()` to return an error (that is ignored).  In both\r\ncases, the driver should not be calling `pnp_unregister_driver()` as it\r\ndoes in `c6xdigio_detach()`.  (Note that `c6xdigio_detach()` will be\r\ncalled by the Comedi core if `c6xdigio_attach()` returns an error, or if\r\nthe Comedi core decides to detach the Comedi device from the driver for\r\nsome other reason.)\r\n\r\nThe unconditional call to `pnp_unregister_driver()` without a previous\r\nsuccessful call to `pnp_register_driver()` will cause\r\n`driver_unregister()` to issue a warning \"Unexpected driver\r\nunregister!\".  This was detected by Syzbot [1].\r\n\r\nAlso, the PNP driver registration and unregistration should be done at\r\nmodule init and exit time, respectively, not when attaching or detaching\r\nComedi devices to the driver.  (There might be more than one Comedi\r\ndevice being attached to the driver, although that is unlikely.)\r\n\r\nChange the driver to do the PNP driver registration at module init time,\r\nand the unregistration at module exit time.

Of course,\r\nit is entirely possible to construct a problematic image that can trigger\r\nthis BUG_ON through specific operations. In fact, I have constructed such\r\nan image and easily reproduced this issue.\r\nTherefore, J_ASSERT() holds true only under ideal conditions, but it may\r\nnot necessarily be satisfied in exceptional scenarios. Using J_ASSERT()\r\ndirectly in abnormal situations would cause the system to crash, which is\r\nclearly not what we want.
