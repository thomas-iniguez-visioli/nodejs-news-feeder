It shows that we miss freeing struct seccomp_filter\nand some objects included in it.\n\nWe can reproduce the issue with the program below [2] which calls one\nseccomp() and two clone() syscalls.\n\nThe first clone()d child exits earlier than its parent and sends a\nsignal to kill it during the second clone(), more precisely before the\nfatal_signal_pending() test in copy_process().  When the parent receives\nthe signal, it has to destroy the embryonic process and return -EINTR to\nuser space.  In the failure path, we have to call seccomp_filter_release()\nto decrement the filter's refcount.\n\nInitially, we called it in free_task() called from the failure path, but\nthe commit 3a15fb6ed92c (\"seccomp release filter after task is fully\ndead\") moved it to release_task() to notify user space as early as possible\nthat the filter is no longer used.\n\nTo keep the change and current seccomp refcount semantics, let's move\ncopy_seccomp() just after the signal check and add a WARN_ON_ONCE() in\nfree_task() for future debugging.\n\n[0]\nunreferenced object 0xffff8880063add00 (size 256)\n  comm \"repro_seccomp\", pid 230, jiffies 4294687090 (age 9.914s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes)\n    01 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n    ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ................\n  backtrace\n    do_seccomp (./include/linux/slab.h600 ./include/linux/slab.h733 kernel/seccomp.c666 kernel/seccomp.c708 kernel/seccomp.c1871 kernel/seccomp.c1991)\n    do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c50 arch/x86/entry/common.c80)\n    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S120)\nunreferenced object 0xffffc90000035000 (size 4096)\n  comm \"repro_seccomp\", pid 230, jiffies 4294687090 (age 9.915s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes)\n    01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 05 00 00 00  ................\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n  backtrace\n    __vmalloc_node_range (mm/vmalloc.c3226)\n    __vmalloc_node (mm/vmalloc.c3261 (discriminator 4))\n    bpf_prog_alloc_no_stats (kernel/bpf/core.c91)\n    bpf_prog_alloc (kernel/bpf/core.c129)\n    bpf_prog_create_from_user (net/core/filter.c1414)\n    do_seccomp (kernel/seccomp.c671 kernel/seccomp.c708 kernel/seccomp.c1871 kernel/seccomp.c1991)\n    do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c50 arch/x86/entry/common.c80)\n    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S120)\nunreferenced object 0xffff888003fa1000 (size 1024)\n  comm \"repro_seccomp\", pid 230, jiffies 4294687090 (age 9.915s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes)\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n  backtrace\n    bpf_prog_alloc_no_stats (./include/linux/slab.h600 ./include/linux/slab.h733 kernel/bpf/core.c95)\n    bpf_prog_alloc (kernel/bpf/core.c129)\n    bpf_prog_create_from_user (net/core/filter.c1414)\n    do_seccomp (kernel/seccomp.c671 kernel/seccomp.c708 kernel/seccomp.c1871 kernel/seccomp.c1991)\n    do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c50 arch/x86/entry/common.c80)\n    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S120)\nunreferenced object 0xffff888006360240 (size 16)\n  comm \"repro_seccomp\", pid 230, jiffies 4294687090 (age 9.915s)\n  hex dump (first 16 bytes)\n    01 00 37 00 76 65 72 6c e0 83 01 06 80 88 ff ff  ..7.verl........\n  backtrace\n    bpf_prog_store_orig_filter (net/core/filter.c1137)\n    bpf_prog_create_from_user (net/core/filter.c1428)\n    do_seccomp (kernel/seccomp.c671 kernel/seccomp.c708 kernel/seccomp.c1871 kernel/seccomp.c1991)\n    do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c50 arch/x86/entry/common.c80)\n    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S120)\nunreferenced object 0xffff888\n---truncated--- | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50661</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2022-50661</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2022-50662 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nRDMA/hns fix memory leak in hn...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nRDMA/hns fix memory leak in hns_roce_alloc_mr()\n\nWhen hns_roce_mr_enable() failed in hns_roce_alloc_mr(), mr_key is not\nreleased.

Therefore mte_sync_tags() could safely use\ntest_and_set_bit(PG_mte_tagged, page->flags) without inadvertently\nsetting PG_mte_tagged on an untagged page.\n\nThe above commit was required as guests may enable MTE without any\ncontrol at the stage 2 mapping, nor a PROT_MTE mapping in the VMM.\nHowever, the side-effect was that any page with a PTE that looked like\nswap (or migration) was getting PG_mte_tagged set automatically. A\nsubsequent page copy (e.g. migration) copied the tags to the destination\npage even if the tags were owned by KASAN.\n\nThis issue was masked by the page_kasan_tag_reset() call introduced in\ncommit e5b8d9218951 (\"arm64 mte reset the page tag in page->flags\").\nWhen this commit was reverted (20794545c146), KASAN started reporting\naccess faults because the overriding tags in a page did not match the\noriginal page->flags (with CONFIG_KASAN_HW_TAGS=y)\n\n  BUG KASAN invalid-access in copy_page+0x10/0xd0 arch/arm64/lib/copy_page.S26\n  Read at addr f5ff000017f2e000 by task

dereference on OF device match\n\nThe affected lines were resulting in a NULL pointer dereference on our\nplatform because the device tree contained the following list of\ncompatible strings\n\n    power-sensor@40 {\n        compatible = \"ti,ina232\", \"ti,ina231\"\n        ...\n    }\n\nSince the driver doesn't declare a compatible string \"ti,ina232\", the OF\nmatching succeeds on \"ti,ina231\". But the I2C device ID info is\npopulated via the first compatible string, cf. modalias population in\nof_i2c_get_board_info(). Since there is no \"ina232\" entry in the legacy\nI2C device ID table either, the struct i2c_device_id *id pointer in the\nprobe function is NULL.\n\nFix this by using the already populated type variable instead, which\npoints to the proper driver data. Since the name is also wanted, add a\ngeneric one to the ina2xx_config table. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53834</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53834</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2023-53835 Rejected reason This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority.</title>\n      <description>Rejected reason This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53835</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53835</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2023-53836 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nbpf, sockmap Fix skb refcnt ra...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nbpf, sockmap Fix skb refcnt race after locking changes\n\nThere is a race where skb's from the sk_psock_backlog can be referenced\nafter userspace side has already skb_consumed() the sk_buff and its refcnt\ndropped to zer0 causing use after free.\n\nThe flow is the following\n\n  while ((skb = skb_peek(psock->ingress_skb))\n    sk_psock_handle_Skb(psock, skb, ..., ingress)\n    if (!ingress) ...\n    sk_psock_skb_ingress\n       sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(skb)\n          msg->skb = skb\n          sk_psock_queue_msg(psock, msg)\n    skb_dequeue(psock->ingress_skb)\n\nThe sk_psock_queue_msg() puts the msg on the ingress_msg queue. This is\nwhat the application reads when recvmsg() is called. An application can\nread this anytime after the msg is placed on the queue. The recvmsg hook\nwill also read msg->skb and then after user space reads the msg will call\nconsume_skb(skb) on it effectively free'ing it.\n\nBut, the race is in above where backlog queue still has a reference to\nthe skb and calls skb_dequeue(). If the skb_dequeue happens after the\nuser reads and free's the skb we have a use after free.\n\nThe !ingress case does not suffer from this problem because it uses\nsendmsg_*(sk, msg) which does not pass the sk_buff further down the\nstack.\n\nThe following splat was observed with 'test_progs -t sockmap_listen'\n\n  [ 1022.710250][ T2556] general protection fault, ...\n  [...]\n  [ 1022.712830][ T2556] Workqueue events sk_psock_backlog\n  [ 1022.713262][ T2556] RIP 0010skb_dequeue+0x4c/0x80\n  [ 1022.713653][ T2556] Code ...\n  [...]\n  [ 1022.720699][ T2556] Call Trace\n  [ 1022.720984][ T2556]  TASK>\n  [ 1022.721254][ T2556]  ? die_addr+0x32/0x80^M\n  [ 1022.721589][ T2556]  ? exc_general_protection+0x25a/0x4b0\n  [ 1022.722026][ T2556]  ? asm_exc_general_protection+0x22/0x30\n  [ 1022.722489][ T2556]  ? skb_dequeue+0x4c/0x80\n  [ 1022.722854][ T2556]  sk_psock_backlog+0x27a/0x300\n  [ 1022.723243][ T2556]  process_one_work+0x2a7/0x5b0\n  [ 1022.723633][ T2556]  worker_thread+0x4f/0x3a0\n  [ 1022.723998][ T2556]  ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\n  [ 1022.724386][ T2556]  kthread+0xfd/0x130\n  [ 1022.724709][ T2556]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n  [ 1022.725066][ T2556]  ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50\n  [ 1022.725409][ T2556]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n  [ 1022.725799][ T2556]  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30\n  [ 1022.726201][ T2556]  /TASK>\n\nTo fix we add an skb_get() before passing the skb to be enqueued in the\nengress queue. This bumps the skb->users refcnt so that consume_skb()\nand kfree_skb will not immediately free the sk_buff. With this we can\nbe sure the skb is still around when we do the dequeue. Then we just\nneed to decrement the refcnt or free the skb in the backlog case which\nwe do by calling kfree_skb() on the ingress case as well as the sendmsg\ncase.\n\nBefore locking change from fixes tag we had the sock locked so we\ncouldn't race with user and there was no issue here. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53836</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53836</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2023-53837 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ndrm/msm fix NULL-deref on snap...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ndrm/msm fix NULL-deref on snapshot tear down\n\nIn case of early initialisation errors and on platforms that do not use\nthe DPU controller, the deinitilisation code can be called with the kms\npointer set to NULL.\n\nPatchwork https//patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/525099/ | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53837</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53837</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2023-53838 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nf2fs synchronize atomic write ...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nf2fs synchronize atomic write aborts\n\nTo fix a race condition between atomic write aborts, I use the inode\nlock and make COW inode to be re-usable thoroughout the whole\natomic file inode lifetime. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53838</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53838</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2023-53839 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ndccp fix data-race around dp->...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ndccp fix data-race around dp->dccps_mss_cache\n\ndccp_sendmsg() reads dp->dccps_mss_cache before locking the socket.\nSame thing in do_dccp_getsockopt().\n\nAdd READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() annotations,\nand change dccp_sendmsg() to check again dccps_mss_cache\nafter socket is locked. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53839</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53839</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2023-53840 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nusb early xhci-dbc Fix a pot...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nusb early xhci-dbc Fix a potential out-of-bound memory access\n\nIf xdbc_bulk_write() fails, the values in 'buf' can be anything.

That means that if you have parts of your driver\nthat aren't using devm or are using \"roll your own\" devm w/\ndevm_add_action_or_reset() you need to keep that in mind.\n\nThe mt8186 audio driver didn't quite get this right. Specifically, in\nmt8186_init_clock() it called mt8186_audsys_clk_register() and then\nwent on to call a bunch of other devm function. The caller of\nmt8186_init_clock() used devm_add_action_or_reset() to call\nmt8186_deinit_clock() but, because of the intervening devm functions,\nthe order was wrong.\n\nSpecifically at probe time, the order was\n1. mt8186_audsys_clk_register()\n2. afe_priv->clk = devm_kcalloc(...)\n3. afe_priv->clk[i] = devm_clk_get(...)\n\nAt remove time, the order (which should have been 3, 2, 1) was\n1. mt8186_audsys_clk_unregister()\n3. Free all of afe_priv->clk[i]\n2. Free afe_priv->clk\n\nThe above seemed to be causing a use-after-free. Luckily, it's easy to\nfix this by simply using devm more correctly. Let's move the\ndevm_add_action_or_reset() to the right place. In addition to fixing\nthe use-after-free, code inspection shows that this fixes a leak\n(missing call to mt8186_audsys_clk_unregister()) that would have\nhappened if any of the syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle() calls in\nmt8186_init_clock() had failed. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53854</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53854</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2023-53855 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nnet dsa ocelot call dsa_tag_...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nnet dsa ocelot call dsa_tag_8021q_unregister() under rtnl_lock() on driver remove\n\nWhen the tagging protocol in current use is \"ocelot-8021q\" and we unbind\nthe driver, we see this splat\n\n$ echo '00000000.2' > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/fsl_enetc/unbind\nmscc_felix 00000000.5 swp0 left promiscuous mode\nsja1105 spi2.0 Link is Down\nDSA tree 1 torn down\nmscc_felix 00000000.5 swp2 left promiscuous mode\nsja1105 spi2.2 Link is Down\nDSA tree 3 torn down\nfsl_enetc 00000000.2 eno2 left promiscuous mode\nmscc_felix 00000000.5 Link is Down\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nRTNL assertion failed at net/dsa/tag_8021q.c (409)\nWARNING CPU 1 PID 329 at net/dsa/tag_8021q.c409 dsa_tag_8021q_unregister+0x12c/0x1a0\nModules linked in\nCPU 1 PID 329 Comm bash Not tainted 6.5.0-rc3+ #771\npc  dsa_tag_8021q_unregister+0x12c/0x1a0\nlr  dsa_tag_8021q_unregister+0x12c/0x1a0\nCall trace\n dsa_tag_8021q_unregister+0x12c/0x1a0\n felix_tag_8021q_teardown+0x130/0x150\n felix_teardown+0x3c/0xd8\n dsa_tree_teardown_switches+0xbc/0xe0\n dsa_unregister_switch+0x168/0x260\n felix_pci_remove+0x30/0x60\n pci_device_remove+0x4c/0x100\n device_release_driver_internal+0x188/0x288\n device_links_unbind_consumers+0xfc/0x138\n device_release_driver_internal+0xe0/0x288\n device_driver_detach+0x24/0x38\n unbind_store+0xd8/0x108\n drv_attr_store+0x30/0x50\n---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nRTNL assertion failed at net/8021q/vlan_core.c (376)\nWARNING CPU 1 PID 329 at net/8021q/vlan_core.c376 vlan_vid_del+0x1b8/0x1f0\nCPU 1 PID 329 Comm bash Tainted G        W          6.5.0-rc3+ #771\npc  vlan_vid_del+0x1b8/0x1f0\nlr  vlan_vid_del+0x1b8/0x1f0\n dsa_tag_8021q_unregister+0x8c/0x1a0\n felix_tag_8021q_teardown+0x130/0x150\n felix_teardown+0x3c/0xd8\n dsa_tree_teardown_switches+0xbc/0xe0\n dsa_unregister_switch+0x168/0x260\n felix_pci_remove+0x30/0x60\n pci_device_remove+0x4c/0x100\n device_release_driver_internal+0x188/0x288\n device_links_unbind_consumers+0xfc/0x138\n device_release_driver_internal+0xe0/0x288\n device_driver_detach+0x24/0x38\n unbind_store+0xd8/0x108\n drv_attr_store+0x30/0x50\nDSA tree 0 torn down\n\nThis was somewhat not so easy to spot, because \"ocelot-8021q\" is not the\ndefault tagging protocol, and thus, not everyone who tests the unbinding\npath may have switched to it beforehand.

In particular for task local storage, it is easy to\nget a \"current\" task PTR_TO_BTF_ID in tracing bpf prog.\nHowever, task (and cgroup) local storage has already been moved to\nbpf mem allocator which can be used after raw_spin_lock.\n\nThe splat is for the sk storage. For sk (and inode) storage,\nit has not been moved to bpf mem allocator. Using raw_spin_lock or not,\nkzalloc(GFP_ATOMIC) could theoretically be unsafe in tracing context.\nHowever, the local storage helper requires a verifier accepted\nsk pointer (PTR_TO_BTF_ID), it is hypothetical if that (mean running\na bpf prog in a kzalloc unsafe context and also able to hold a verifier\naccepted sk pointer) could happen.\n\nThis patch avoids kzalloc after raw_spin_lock to silent the splat.\nThere is an existing kzalloc before the raw_spin_lock. At that point,\na kzalloc is very likely required because a lookup has just been done\nbefore. Thus, this patch always does the kzalloc before acq\n---truncated--- | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53857</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53857</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2023-53858 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ntty serial samsung_tty Fix a...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ntty serial samsung_tty Fix a memory leak in s3c24xx_serial_getclk() in case of error\n\nIf clk_get_rate() fails, the clk that has just been allocated needs to be\nfreed. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53858</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53858</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2023-53859 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ns390/idle mark arch_cpu_idle()...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ns390/idle mark arch_cpu_idle() noinstr\n\nlinux-next commit (\"cpuidle tracing Warn about !rcu_is_watching()\")\nadds a new warning which hits on s390's arch_cpu_idle() function\n\nRCU not on for arch_cpu_idle+0x0/0x28\nWARNING CPU 2 PID 0 at include/linux/trace_recursion.h162 arch_ftrace_ops_list_func+0x24c/0x258\nModules linked in\nCPU 2 PID 0 Comm swapper/2 Not tainted 6.2.0-rc6-next-20230202 #4\nHardware name IBM 8561 T01 703 (z/VM 7.3.0)\nKrnl PSW  0404d00180000000 00000000002b55c0 (arch_ftrace_ops_list_func+0x250/0x258)\n           R0 T1 IO0 EX0 Key0 M1 W0 P0 AS3 CC1 PM0 RI0 EA3\nKrnl GPRS c0000000ffffbfff 0000000080000002 0000000000000026 0000000000000000\n           0000037ffffe3a28 0000037ffffe3a20 0000000000000000 0000000000000000\n           0000000000000000 0000000000f4acf6 00000000001044f0 0000037ffffe3cb0\n           0000000000000000 0000000000000000 00000000002b55bc 0000037ffffe3bb8\nKrnl Code 00000000002b55b0 c02000840051        larl    %r2,0000000001335652\n           00000000002b55b6 c0e5fff512d1        brasl   %r14,0000000000157b58\n          #00000000002b55bc af000000            mc      0,0\n          >00000000002b55c0 a7f4ffe7            brc     15,00000000002b558e\n           00000000002b55c4 0707                bcr     0,%r7\n           00000000002b55c6 0707                bcr     0,%r7\n           00000000002b55c8 eb6ff0480024        stmg    %r6,%r15,72(%r15)\n           00000000002b55ce b90400ef            lgr     %r14,%r15\nCall Trace\n [00000000002b55c0>] arch_ftrace_ops_list_func+0x250/0x258\n([00000000002b55bc>] arch_ftrace_ops_list_func+0x24c/0x258)\n [0000000000f5f0fc>] ftrace_common+0x1c/0x20\n [00000000001044f6>] arch_cpu_idle+0x6/0x28\n [0000000000f4acf6>] default_idle_call+0x76/0x128\n [00000000001cc374>] do_idle+0xf4/0x1b0\n [00000000001cc6ce>] cpu_startup_entry+0x36/0x40\n [0000000000119d00>] smp_start_secondary+0x140/0x150\n [0000000000f5d2ae>] restart_int_handler+0x6e/0x90\n\nMark arch_cpu_idle() noinstr like all other architectures with\nCONFIG_ARCH_WANTS_NO_INSTR (should) have it to fix this. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53859</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53859</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2023-53860 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ndm don't attempt to queue IO u...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ndm don't attempt to queue IO under RCU protection\n\ndm looks up the table for IO based on the request type, with an\nassumption that if the request is marked REQ_NOWAIT, it's fine to\nattempt to submit that IO while under RCU read lock protection.

The __perf_event_overflow() callback\nis invoked from the hrtimer handler for cpu-clock events, and\n__perf_event_overflow() tries to call cpu_clock_event_stop()\nto stop the event, which calls htimer_cancel() to cancel the hrtimer.\n\nBut that's a recursion into the hrtimer code from a hrtimer handler,\nwhich (unsurprisingly) deadlocks.\n\nTo fix this bug, use hrtimer_try_to_cancel() instead, and set\nthe PERF_HES_STOPPED flag, which causes perf_swevent_hrtimer()\nto stop the event once it sees the PERF_HES_STOPPED flag.\n\n[ mingo Fixed the comments and improved the changelog. ] | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40327</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-40327</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-40328 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nsmb client fix potential UAF ...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nsmb client fix potential UAF in smb2_close_cached_fid()\n\nfind_or_create_cached_dir() could grab a new reference after kref_put()\nhad seen the refcount drop to zero but before cfid_list_lock is acquired\nin smb2_close_cached_fid(), leading to use-after-free.\n\nSwitch to kref_put_lock() so cfid_release() is called with\ncfid_list_lock held, closing that gap. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40328</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-40328</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-40329 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ndrm/sched Fix deadlock in drm_...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ndrm/sched Fix deadlock in drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb\n\nThe Mesa issue referenced below pointed out a possible deadlock\n\n[ 1231.611031]  Possible interrupt unsafe locking scenario\n\n[ 1231.611033]        CPU0                    CPU1\n[ 1231.611034]        ----                    ----\n[ 1231.611035]   lock(xa->xa_lock#17)\n[ 1231.611038]                                local_irq_disable()\n[ 1231.611039]                                lock(fence->lock)\n[ 1231.611041]                                lock(xa->xa_lock#17)\n[ 1231.611044]   Interrupt>\n[ 1231.611045]     lock(fence->lock)\n[ 1231.611047]\n                *** DEADLOCK ***\n\nIn this example, CPU0 would be any function accessing job->dependencies\nthrough the xa_* functions that don't disable interrupts (eg\ndrm_sched_job_add_dependency(), drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb()).\n\nCPU1 is executing drm_sched_entity_kill_jobs_cb() as a fence signalling\ncallback so in an interrupt context.

This check is racy against a concurrent exec() in the\ntarget process.\n\nDuring exec(), a task may transition from a non-privileged binary to a\nprivileged one (e.g., setuid binary) and its credentials/memory mappings\nmay change. If get_robust_list() performs ptrace_may_access() before\nthis transition, it may erroneously allow access to sensitive information\nafter the target becomes privileged.\n\nA racy access allows an attacker to exploit a window during which\nptrace_may_access() passes before a target process transitions to a\nprivileged state via exec().\n\nFor example, consider a non-privileged task T that is about to execute a\nsetuid-root binary. An attacker task A calls get_robust_list(T) while T\nis still unprivileged. Since ptrace_may_access() checks permissions\nbased on current credentials, it succeeds. However, if T begins exec\nimmediately afterwards, it becomes privileged and may change its memory\nmappings. Because get_robust_list() proceeds to access T->robust_list\nwithout synchronizing with exec() it may read user-space pointers from a\nnow-privileged process.\n\nThis violates the intended post-exec access restrictions and could\nexpose sensitive memory addresses or be used as a primitive in a larger\nexploit chain. Consequently, the race can lead to unauthorized\ndisclosure of information across privilege boundaries and poses a\npotential security risk.\n\nTake a read lock on signal->exec_update_lock prior to invoking\nptrace_may_access() and accessing the robust_list/compat_robust_list.\nThis ensures that the target task's exec state remains stable during the\ncheck, allowing for consistent and synchronized validation of\ncredentials. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40341</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-40341</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-40342 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nnvme-fc use lock accessing por...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nnvme-fc use lock accessing port_state and rport state\n\nnvme_fc_unregister_remote removes the remote port on a lport object at\nany point in time when there is no active association.

As a\nresult, it is possible for the first scheduled work item to free all\nresources, and then for the same work item to be scheduled again for\ndeletion.\n\nBecause the association list is an RCU list, it is not possible to take\na lock and remove the list entry directly, so it cannot be looked up\nagain. Instead, a flag (terminating) must be used to determine whether\nthe association is already in the process of being deleted. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40343</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-40343</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-40344 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nASoC Intel avs Disable perio...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nASoC Intel avs Disable periods-elapsed work when closing PCM\n\navs_dai_fe_shutdown() handles the shutdown procedure for HOST HDAudio\nstream while period-elapsed work services its IRQs.

Versions 2.0.13 and below allow an unauthenticated attacker to disable CAPTCHA verification by abusing a client-controlled parameter. Because the server previously trusted this value without proper validation, CAPTCHA protections can be bypassed, enabling automated login attempts and significantly increasing the risk of account takeover (ATO).

Versions 2.0.14 and below use Gin's default configuration which trusts all IP addresses as proxies (TrustedProxies = 0.0.0.0/0), allowing any client to spoof the X-Forwarded-For header. Since all IP-based access controls (AllowIPs, API whitelists, localhost-only checks) rely on ClientIP(), attackers can bypass these protections by simply sending X-Forwarded-For  127.0.0.1 or any whitelisted IP. This renders all IP-based security controls ineffective.

The vulnerability occurs through two related but distinct failure paths, both ultimately caused by crypto/rand.Read() failures, compromising the security of all Fiber applications using these functions for security-critical operations. This issue is fixed in version 2.0.0-rc.4. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:18:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66565</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-66565</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-66567 The ruby-saml library is for implementing the client side of a SAML authorization. ruby-saml version...</title>\n      <description>The ruby-saml library is for implementing the client side of a SAML authorization. ruby-saml versions up to and including 1.12.4 contain an authentication bypass vulnerability due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2025-25292.

Versions up to and including 1.12.4, are vulnerable to authentication bypass through the libxml2 canonicalization process used by Nokogiri for document transformation, which allows an attacker to execute a Signature Wrapping attack. When libxml2’s canonicalization is invoked on an invalid XML input, it may return an empty string rather than a canonicalized node. ruby-saml then proceeds to compute the DigestValue over this empty string, treating it as if canonicalization succeeded.

Versions 3.1.3 contain an authentication bypass vulnerability due to a flaw in the libxml2 canonicalization process during document transformation. When libxml2’s canonicalization is invoked on an invalid XML input, it may return an empty string rather than a canonicalized node. xmlseclibs then proceeds to compute the DigestValue over this empty string, treating it as if canonicalization succeeded. This issue is fixed in version 3.1.4. Workarounds include treating canonicalization failures (exceptions or nil/empty outputs) as fatal and aborting validation, and/or adding explicit checks to reject when canonicalize returns nil/empty or raises errors. | CVSS Score 6 (MEDIUM)  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:18:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66578</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-66578</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-66622 matrix-sdk-base is the base component to build a Matrix client library.

The next insn to explore is set to\r\nstart of subprog and the exit from nested frame is handled using\r\ncurframe > 0 and prepare_func_exit. In case of async callback it uses a\r\ncustomized variant of push_stack simulating a kind of branch to set up\r\ncustom state and execution context for the async callback.\r\n\r\nWhile this approach is simple and works when callback really will be\r\nexecuted only once, it is unsafe for all of our current helpers which\r\nare for_each style, i.e. they execute the callback multiple times.\r\n\r\nA callback releasing acquired references of the caller may do so\r\nmultiple times, but currently verifier sees it as one call inside the\r\nframe, which then returns to caller. Hence, it thinks it released some\r\nreference that the cb e.g. got access through callback_ctx (register\r\nfilled inside cb from spilled typed register on stack).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it may see that an acquire call is unpaired inside the\r\ncallback, so the caller will copy the reference state of callback and\r\nthen will have to release the register with new ref_obj_ids. But again,\r\nthe callback may execute multiple times, but the verifier will only\r\naccount for acquired references for a single symbolic execution of the\r\ncallback, which will cause leaks.\r\n\r\nNote that for async callback case, things are different. While currently\r\nwe have bpf_timer_set_callback which only executes it once, even for\r\nmultiple executions it would be safe, as reference state is NULL and\r\ncheck_reference_leak would force program to release state before\r\nBPF_EXIT. The state is also unaffected by analysis for the caller frame.\r\nHence async callback is safe.\r\n\r\nSince we want the reference state to be accessible, e.g. for pointers\r\nloaded from stack through callback_ctx's PTR_TO_STACK, we still have to\r\ncopy caller's reference_state to callback's bpf_func_state, but we\r\nenforce that whatever references it adds to that reference_state has\r\nbeen released before it hits BPF_EXIT. This requires introducing a new\r\ncallback_ref member in the reference state to distinguish between caller\r\nvs callee references. Hence, check_reference_leak now errors out if it\r\nsees we are in callback_fn and we have not released callback_ref refs.\r\nSince there can be multiple nested callbacks, like frame 0 -> cb1 -> cb2\r\netc. we need to also distinguish between whether this particular ref\r\nbelongs to this callback frame or parent, and only error for our own, so\r\nwe store state->frameno (which is always non-zero for callbacks).\r\n\r\nIn short, callbacks can read parent reference_state, but cannot mutate\r\nit, to be able to use pointers acquired by the caller. They must only\r\nundo their changes (by releasing their own acquired_refs before\r\nBPF_EXIT) on top of caller reference_state before returning (at which\r\npoint the caller and callback state will match anyway, so no need to\r\ncopy it back to caller). | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50650</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2022-50650</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2022-50651 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nethtool eeprom fix null-deref...</title>\r\n      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nethtool eeprom fix null-deref on genl_info in dump\r\n\r\nThe similar fix as commit 46cdedf2a0fa (\"ethtool pse-pd fix null-deref on\r\ngenl_info in dump\") is also needed for ethtool eeprom. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50651</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2022-50651</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2022-50652 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nuio uio_dmem_genirq Fix missi...</title>\r\n      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nuio uio_dmem_genirq Fix missing unlock in irq configuration\r\n\r\nCommit b74351287d4b (\"uio fix a sleep-in-atomic-context bug in\r\nuio_dmem_genirq_irqcontrol()\") started calling disable_irq() without\r\nholding the spinlock because it can sleep.

Instead, let's avoid hooked chains completely\r\nuntil I could work out a proper way to fix this and end users finally\r\ntell us that it's needed to add it back.\r\n\r\nActually, this optimization can be found with multi-threaded workloads\r\n(especially even more often on deduplicated compressed images), yet I'm\r\nnot sure about the overall system impacts of not having this compared\r\nwith implementation complexity. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53777</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53777</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-53778 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\naccel/qaic Clean up integer ov...</title>\r\n      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\naccel/qaic Clean up integer overflow checking in map_user_pages()\r\n\r\nThe encode_dma() function has some validation on in_trans->size but it\r\nwould be more clear to move those checks to find_and_map_user_pages().\r\n\r\nThe encode_dma() had two checks\r\n\r\n\tif (in_trans->addr + in_trans->size  in_trans->addr || !in_trans->size)\r\n\t\treturn -EINVAL\r\n\r\nThe in_trans->addr variable is the starting address.  The in_trans->size\r\nvariable is the total size of the transfer.  The transfer can occur in\r\nparts and the resources->xferred_dma_size tracks how many bytes we have\r\nalready transferred.\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces a new variable \"remaining\" which represents the\r\namount we want to transfer (in_trans->size) minus the amount we have\r\nalready transferred (resources->xferred_dma_size).\r\n\r\nI have modified the check for if in_trans->size is zero to instead check\r\nif in_trans->size is less than resources->xferred_dma_size.  If we have\r\nalready transferred more bytes than in_trans->size then there are negative\r\nbytes remaining which doesn't make sense.  If there are zero bytes\r\nremaining to be copied, just return success.\r\n\r\nThe check in encode_dma() checked that \"addr + size\" could not overflow\r\nand barring a driver bug that should work, but it's easier to check if\r\nwe do this in parts.  First check that \"in_trans->addr +\r\nresources->xferred_dma_size\" is safe.  Then check that \"xfer_start_addr +\r\nremaining\" is safe.\r\n\r\nMy final concern was that we are dealing with u64 values but on 32bit\r\nsystems the kmalloc() function will truncate the sizes to 32 bits.  So\r\nI calculated \"total = in_trans->size + offset_in_page(xfer_start_addr)\"\r\nand returned -EINVAL if it were >= SIZE_MAX.

This assumption\r\ntypically is satisfied when the skb was allocated in the net core for\r\ntransmission via the mt7921 netdev (although even that is only an\r\noptimization and is not strictly guaranteed), but the assumption is\r\nsometimes not satisfied when the skb originated in the receive path of\r\nanother netdev and was passed through to the mt7921, such as by the\r\nbridge layer.

This was\r\nleading to a BUG_ON() being hit [1] when we missed a PA that could satisfy\r\nour request and ultimately tried to create a new PA that would overlap\r\nwith the missed one.\r\n\r\nTo makes sure we handle that case while still keeping the performance of\r\nthe rbtree, we make use of the fact that the only pa that could possibly\r\noverlap the original goal start is the one that satisfies the below\r\nconditions\r\n\r\n  1. It must have it's logical start immediately to the left of\r\n  (ie less than) original logical start.\r\n\r\n  2. It must not be deleted\r\n\r\nTo find this pa we use the following traversal method\r\n\r\n1. Descend into the rbtree normally to find the immediate neighboring\r\nPA. Here we keep descending irrespective of if the PA is deleted or if\r\nit overlaps with our request etc. The goal is to find an immediately\r\nadjacent PA.\r\n\r\n2. If the found PA is on right of original goal, use rb_prev() to find\r\nthe left adjacent PA.\r\n\r\n3. Check if this PA is deleted and keep moving left with rb_prev() until\r\na non deleted PA is found.\r\n\r\n4. This is the PA we are looking for. Now we can check if it can satisfy\r\nthe original request and proceed accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis approach also takes care of having deleted PAs in the tree.\r\n\r\n(While we are at it, also fix a possible overflow bug in calculating the\r\nend of a PA)\r\n\r\n[1] https//lore.kernel.org/linux-ext4/CA+G9fYv2FRpLqBZf34ZinR8bU2_ZRAUOjKAD3+tKRFaEQHtt8Q@mail.gmail.com/ | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53813</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53813</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-53814 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nPCI Fix dropping valid root bu...</title>\r\n      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nPCI Fix dropping valid root bus resources with .end = zero\r\n\r\nOn r8a7791/koelsch\r\n\r\n  kmemleak 1 new suspected memory leaks (see /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak)\r\n  # cat /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak\r\n  unreferenced object 0xc3a34e00 (size 64)\r\n    comm \"swapper/0\", pid 1, jiffies 4294937460 (age 199.080s)\r\n    hex dump (first 32 bytes)\r\n      b4 5d 81 f0 b4 5d 81 f0 c0 b0 a2 c3 00 00 00 00  .]...]..........\r\n      00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\r\n    backtrace\r\n      [fe3aa979>] __kmalloc+0xf0/0x140\r\n      [34bd6bc0>] resource_list_create_entry+0x18/0x38\r\n      [767046bc>] pci_add_resource_offset+0x20/0x68\r\n      [b3f3edf2>] devm_of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources.constprop.0+0xb0/0x390\r\n\r\nWhen coalescing two resources for a contiguous aperture, the second\r\nresource is enlarged to cover the full contiguous range, while the first\r\nresource is marked invalid.

When Traefik uses path-based routing, requests containing URL-encoded restricted characters (/, \\, Null, , ?, #) can bypass the middleware chain and reach unintended backends. For example, a request to http//mydomain.example.com/admin%2F could reach service-a without triggering my-security-middleware, bypassing security controls for the /admin/ path.

This flaw leaves \r\nthe application vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks\r\n an attacker who tricks a logged-in user into visiting a malicious \r\nwebsite could cause the user’s browser to issue GET requests that \r\nperform unintended state-changing operations in the context of their \r\nauthenticated session.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the server would treat these GET requests as valid (since no \r\nCSRF protection or POST method enforcement was in place), the attacker \r\ncould exploit this to escalate privileges, change settings, or carry out\r\n other unauthorized actions without needing the user’s explicit consent \r\nor awareness. \r\nThe fix ensures that all state-changing endpoints now require HTTP POST \r\nrequests and include a valid CSRF token.
