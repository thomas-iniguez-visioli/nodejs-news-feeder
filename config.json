This flaw leaves \r\nthe application vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks\r\n an attacker who tricks a logged-in user into visiting a malicious \r\nwebsite could cause the user’s browser to issue GET requests that \r\nperform unintended state-changing operations in the context of their \r\nauthenticated session.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the server would treat these GET requests as valid (since no \r\nCSRF protection or POST method enforcement was in place), the attacker \r\ncould exploit this to escalate privileges, change settings, or carry out\r\n other unauthorized actions without needing the user’s explicit consent \r\nor awareness. \r\nThe fix ensures that all state-changing endpoints now require HTTP POST \r\nrequests and include a valid CSRF token. This enforces that state \r\nchanges cannot be triggered by arbitrary cross-site GET requests. This issue affects Vulnerability-Lookup before 2.18.0. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 13:15:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-42616</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-42616</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2025-42620 In affected versions, vulnerability-lookup handled user-controlled \r\ncontent in comments and bundles ...</title>\r\n      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In affected versions, vulnerability-lookup handled user-controlled \r\ncontent in comments and bundles in an unsafe way, which could lead to \r\nstored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the backend, the related_vulnerabilities field of bundles accepted \r\narbitrary strings without format validation or proper sanitization. On \r\nthe frontend, comment and bundle descriptions were converted from \r\nMarkdown to HTML and then injected directly into the DOM using string \r\ntemplates and innerHTML. This combination allowed an attacker who could \r\ncreate or edit comments or bundles to store crafted HTML/JavaScript \r\npayloads which would later be rendered and executed in the browser of \r\nany user visiting the affected profile page (user.html). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis issue affects Vulnerability-Lookup before 2.18.0. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 13:15:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-42620</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-42620</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Voici la meilleure façon d’utiliser Google Agenda sur Windows 11</title>\r\n      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[div class=\"chapo has-text-weight-semibold mb-5\">\r\ndiv>Astral permet aux utilisateurs sur Windows d'avoir accès à une application native pour gérer leur Google Agenda.
