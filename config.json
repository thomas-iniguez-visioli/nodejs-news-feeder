Dating back to the previous year, the incident was attributed to the ActiveCampaign email marketing service provider and resulted in the exposure of 188k unique email addresses. A small number of records also included name, IP address and country of origin. No Vultr systems or additional customer data were impacted. Vultr subsequently self-submitted the impacted data to HIBP.  ]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 01:22:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/Vultr</link>\r\n      <guid>https://haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/Vultr</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Fuite de données chez Resana</title>\r\n      <description><![CDATA[\r\n                \r\n              ]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue Nov 18 2025 01:00:00 GMT+0100 (heure normale d’Europe centrale)</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//bonjourlafuite.eu.org/#Resana-2025-11-18</link>\r\n      <guid>https://www.numerama.com/cyberguerre/2120401-chantage-en-cours-sur-des-agents-et-fonctionnaires-de-letat-francais-des-hackers-ont-exfiltre-des-donnees-dune-plateforme-interministerielle.html</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Fuite de données chez Synbird</title>\r\n      <description><![CDATA[nom, prénom, email, numéro de téléphone, heure, date et lieu de rendez-vous médicaux, autres éléments médicaux  ]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue Nov 18 2025 01:00:00 GMT+0100 (heure normale d’Europe centrale)</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//bonjourlafuite.eu.org/#Synbird-2025-11-18</link>\r\n      <guid>https://france3-regions.franceinfo.fr/bretagne/finistere/quimper/vol-massif-de-donnees-en-bretagne-au-moins-cinq-communes-touchees-l-enquete-s-accelere-voici-ce-que-l-on-sait-3252205.html</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Un aspirateur connecté qui se retourne contre son propriétaire</title>\r\n      <description><![CDATA[Un robot iLife A11 désactivé à distance après blocage de la télémétrie.
