This\nis for reading and writing page table accessed bits.  If\npte_offset_map_lock() fails, it retries by returning the page table walk\ncallback function with ACTION_AGAIN.\n\npte_offset_map_lock() can continuously fail if the target is a pmd\nmigration entry, though.  Hence it could cause an infinite page table walk\nif the migration cannot be done until the page table walk is finished. \nThis indeed caused a soft lockup when CPU hotplugging and DAMON were\nrunning in parallel.\n\nAvoid the infinite loop by simply not retrying the page table walk.  DAMON\nis promising only a best-effort accuracy, so missing access to such pages\nis no problem. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:15:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40218</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-40218</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-40219 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nPCI/IOV Add PCI rescan-remove ...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nPCI/IOV Add PCI rescan-remove locking when enabling/disabling SR-IOV\n\nBefore disabling SR-IOV via config space accesses to the parent PF,\nsriov_disable() first removes the PCI devices representing the VFs.\n\nSince commit 9d16947b7583 (\"PCI Add global pci_lock_rescan_remove()\")\nsuch removal operations are serialized against concurrent remove and\nrescan using the pci_rescan_remove_lock. No such locking was ever added\nin sriov_disable() however. In particular when commit 18f9e9d150fc\n(\"PCI/IOV Factor out sriov_add_vfs()\") factored out the PCI device\nremoval into sriov_del_vfs() there was still no locking around the\npci_iov_remove_virtfn() calls.\n\nOn s390 the lack of serialization in sriov_disable() may cause double\nremove and list corruption with the below (amended) trace being observed\n\n  PSW  0704c00180000000 0000000c914e4b38 (klist_put+56)\n  GPRS 000003800313fb48 0000000000000000 0000000100000001 0000000000000001\n\t00000000f9b520a8 0000000000000000 0000000000002fbd 00000000f4cc9480\n\t0000000000000001 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000180692828\n\t00000000818e8000 000003800313fe2c 000003800313fb20 000003800313fad8\n  #0 [3800313fb20] device_del at c9158ad5c\n  #1 [3800313fb88] pci_remove_bus_device at c915105ba\n  #2 [3800313fbd0] pci_iov_remove_virtfn at c9152f198\n  #3 [3800313fc28] zpci_iov_remove_virtfn at c90fb67c0\n  #4 [3800313fc60] zpci_bus_remove_device at c90fb6104\n  #5 [3800313fca0] __zpci_event_availability at c90fb3dca\n  #6 [3800313fd08] chsc_process_sei_nt0 at c918fe4a2\n  #7 [3800313fd60] crw_collect_info at c91905822\n  #8 [3800313fe10] kthread at c90feb390\n  #9 [3800313fe68] __ret_from_fork at c90f6aa64\n  #10 [3800313fe98] ret_from_fork at c9194f3f2.\n\nThis is because in addition to sriov_disable() removing the VFs, the\nplatform also generates hot-unplug events for the VFs. This being the\nreverse operation to the hotplug events generated by sriov_enable() and\nhandled via pdev->no_vf_scan. And while the event processing takes\npci_rescan_remove_lock and checks whether the struct pci_dev still exists,\nthe lack of synchronization makes this checking racy.\n\nOther races may also be possible of course though given that this lack of\nlocking persisted so long observable races seem very rare. Even on s390 the\nlist corruption was only observed with certain devices since the platform\nevents are only triggered by config accesses after the removal, so as long\nas the removal finished synchronously they would not race. Either way the\nlocking is missing so fix this by adding it to the sriov_del_vfs() helper.\n\nJust like PCI rescan-remove, locking is also missing in sriov_add_vfs()\nincluding for the error case where pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device() is\ncalled without the PCI rescan-remove lock being held. Even in the non-error\ncase, adding new PCI devices and buses should be serialized via the PCI\nrescan-remove lock. Add the necessary locking. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:15:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40219</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-40219</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-40220 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nfuse fix livelock in synchrono...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nfuse fix livelock in synchronous file put from fuseblk workers\n\nI observed a hang when running generic/323 against a fuseblk server.\nThis test opens a file, initiates a lot of AIO writes to that file\ndescriptor, and closes the file descriptor before the writes complete.\nUnsurprisingly, the AIO exerciser threads are mostly stuck waiting for\nresponses from the fuseblk server\n\n# cat /proc/372265/task/372313/stack\n[0>] request_wait_answer+0x1fe/0x2a0 [fuse]\n[0>] __fuse_simple_request+0xd3/0x2b0 [fuse]\n[0>] fuse_do_getattr+0xfc/0x1f0 [fuse]\n[0>] fuse_file_read_iter+0xbe/0x1c0 [fuse]\n[0>] aio_read+0x130/0x1e0\n[0>] io_submit_one+0x542/0x860\n[0>] __x64_sys_io_submit+0x98/0x1a0\n[0>] do_syscall_64+0x37/0xf0\n[0>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\n\nBut the /weird/ part is that the fuseblk server threads are waiting for\nresponses from itself\n\n# cat /proc/372210/task/372232/stack\n[0>] request_wait_answer+0x1fe/0x2a0 [fuse]\n[0>] __fuse_simple_request+0xd3/0x2b0 [fuse]\n[0>] fuse_file_put+0x9a/0xd0 [fuse]\n[0>] fuse_release+0x36/0x50 [fuse]\n[0>] __fput+0xec/0x2b0\n[0>] task_work_run+0x55/0x90\n[0>] syscall_exit_to_user_mode+0xe9/0x100\n[0>] do_syscall_64+0x43/0xf0\n[0>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\n\nThe fuseblk server is fuse2fs so there's nothing all that exciting in\nthe server itself.  So why is the fuse server calling fuse_file_put?\nThe commit message for the fstest sheds some light on that\n\n\"By closing the file descriptor before calling io_destroy, you pretty\nmuch guarantee that the last put on the ioctx will be done in interrupt\ncontext (during I/O completion).\n\nAha.  AIO fgets a new struct file from the fd when it queues the ioctx.\nThe completion of the FUSE_WRITE command from userspace causes the fuse\nserver to call the AIO completion function.  The completion puts the\nstruct file, queuing a delayed fput to the fuse server task.  When the\nfuse server task returns to userspace, it has to run the delayed fput,\nwhich in the case of a fuseblk server, it does synchronously.\n\nSending the FUSE_RELEASE command sychronously from fuse server threads\nis a bad idea because a client program can initiate enough simultaneous\nAIOs such that all the fuse server threads end up in delayed_fput, and\nnow there aren't any threads left to handle the queued fuse commands.\n\nFix this by only using asynchronous fputs when closing files, and leave\na comment explaining why. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:15:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40220</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-40220</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-40221 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nmedia pci mg4b fix uninitial...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nmedia pci mg4b fix uninitialized iio scan data\n\nFix potential leak of uninitialized stack data to userspace by ensuring\nthat the `scan` structure is zeroed before use. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:15:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40221</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-40221</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-53963 An issue was discovered on Thermo Fisher Ion Torrent OneTouch 2 INS1005527 devices.

A remote code ...</title>\n      <description>An issue was discovered in the Thermo Fisher Torrent Suite Django application 5.18.1. A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the network configuration functionality, stemming from insufficient input validation when processing network configuration parameters through administrative endpoints. The application allows administrators to modify the server's network configuration through the Django application. This configuration is processed by Bash scripts (TSsetnoproxy and TSsetproxy) that write user-controlled data directly to environment variables without proper sanitization. After updating environment variables, the scripts execute a source command on /etc/environment if an attacker injects malicious data into environment variables, this command can enable arbitrary command execution. The vulnerability begins with the /admin/network endpoint, which passes user-supplied form data as arguments to subprocess.Popen calls. The user-supplied input is then used to update environment variables in TSsetnoproxy and TSsetproxy, and finally source $environment is executed. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:15:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54306</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-54306</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-54307 An issue was discovered in the Thermo Fisher Torrent Suite Django application 5.18.1.

The /configure/plugins/plugin/upload/zip/ and /configure/newupdates/offline/bundle/upload/ endpoints allow low-privilege users to upload ZIP files to the server. The plupload_file_upload function handles these file uploads and constructs the destination file path by using either the name parameter or the uploaded filename, neither of which is properly sanitized. The file extension is extracted by splitting the filename, and a format string is used to construct the final file path, leaving the destination path vulnerable to path traversal. An authenticated attacker with network connectivity can write arbitrary files to the server, enabling remote code execution after overwriting an executable file. An example is the pdflatex executable, which is executed through subprocess.Popen in the write_report_pdf function after requests to a /report/latex/(\\d+).pdf endpoint. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:15:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54307</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-54307</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-65346 alexusmai laravel-file-manager 3.3.1 and below is vulnerable to Directory Traversal.

If a reference to that user state still\r\nexists, the fallback state will remain on the hashtables/lists,\r\ntriggering the WARN in xfrm_state_fini. Because of those remaining\r\nreferences, the fix in commit f75a2804da39 (\"xfrm destroy xfrm_state\r\nsynchronously on net exit path\") is not complete.\r\n\r\nWe recently fixed one such situation in TCP due to defered freeing of\r\nskbs (commit 9b6412e6979f (\"tcp drop secpath at the same time as we\r\ncurrently drop dst\")). This can also happen due to IP reassembly skbs\r\nwith a secpath remain on the reassembly queue until netns\r\ndestruction. If we can't guarantee that the queues are flushed by the\r\ntime xfrm_state_fini runs, there may still be references to a (user)\r\nxfrm_state, preventing the timely deletion of the corresponding\r\nfallback state.\r\n\r\nInstead of chasing each instance of skbs holding a secpath one by one,\r\nthis patch fixes the issue directly within xfrm, by deleting the\r\nfallback state as soon as the last user state depending on it has been\r\ndeleted. Destruction will still happen when the final reference is\r\ndropped.\r\n\r\nA separate lockdep class for the fallback state is required since\r\nwe're going to lock x->tunnel while x is locked. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:15:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40215</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-40215</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Pourquoi vous allez bientôt croiser des voitures dotées de plaques rose en France</title>\r\n      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[div class=\"chapo has-text-weight-semibold mb-5\">\r\ndiv>Pour éviter la fraude aux immatriculations temporaires ou de garage, l'État a décidé de durcir les règles.
