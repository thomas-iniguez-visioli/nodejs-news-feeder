These collisions could overwrite or shadow critical application state objects used by certain Project views, leading to unintended server-side POST requests or other unauthorized backend interactions. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to have access to the target GitHub Enterprise Server instance and to entice a privileged user to view crafted malicious content that includes conflicting HTML elements. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.18.3, 3.17.9, 3.16.12, 3.15.16, and 3.14.21. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  </description>\r\n      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 18:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14046</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-14046</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2025-14529 A flaw has been found in Campcodes Retro Basketball Shoes Online Store 1.0.

When Optional Content Groups (OCG) are supported, the state property of an OCG is runtime-only and not included in the digital signature computation buffer. An attacker can leverage JavaScript or PDF triggers to dynamically change the visibility of OCG content after signing (Post-Sign), allowing the visual content of a signed PDF to be modified without invalidating the signature. This may result in a mismatch between the signed content and what the signer or verifier sees, undermining the trustworthiness of the digital signature.

In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c).

On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value.
