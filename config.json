Versions 0.123.1 through 1.119.1 do not have adequate protections to prevent RCE through the project's pre-commit hooks. The Add Config operation allows workflows to set arbitrary Git configuration values, including core.hooksPath, which can point to a malicious Git hook that executes arbitrary commands on the n8n host during subsequent Git operations. Exploitation requires the ability to create or modify an n8n workflow using the Git node. This issue is fixed in version 1.119.2. Workarounds include excluding the Git Node (Docs) and avoiding cloning or interacting with untrusted repositories using the Git Node. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 00:15:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65964</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-65964</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-66202 Astro is a web framework.

Versions 5.15.7 and below have a double URL encoding bypass which allows any unauthenticated attacker to bypass path-based authentication checks in Astro middleware, granting unauthorized access to protected routes. While the original CVE-2025-64765 was fixed in v5.15.8, the fix is insufficient as it only decodes once. By using double-encoded URLs, attackers can still bypass authentication and access any route protected by middleware pathname checks.

Version 1.6.4 contains a brute-force protection bypass where an attacker can indefinitely reset the counter by modifying `X-Forwarded-For` on each request, gaining unlimited password guessing attempts, effectively bypassing all brute-force protection.

And Bug_ON is triggered due to the incorrect extents.\n\nWhen the boot loader inode is not initialized, its imode can be one of the\nfollowing\n1) the imode is a bad type, which is marked as bad_inode in ext4_iget and\n   set to S_IFREG.\n2) the imode is good type but not S_IFREG.\n3) the imode is S_IFREG.\n\nThe BUG_ON may be triggered by bypassing the check in cases 1 and 2.\nTherefore, when the boot loader inode is bad_inode or its imode is not\nS_IFREG, initialize the inode to avoid triggering the BUG. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50638</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2022-50638</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2022-50639 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nio-wq Fix memory leak in worke...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nio-wq Fix memory leak in worker creation\n\nIf the CPU mask allocation for a node fails, then the memory allocated for\nthe 'io_wqe' struct of the current node doesn't get freed on the error\nhandling path, since it has not yet been added to the 'wqes' array.\n\nThis was spotted when fuzzing v6.1-rc1 with Syzkaller\nBUG memory leak\nunreferenced object 0xffff8880093d5000 (size 1024)\n  comm \"syz-executor.2\", pid 7701, jiffies 4295048595 (age 13.900s)\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes)\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n  backtrace\n    [00000000cb463369>] __kmem_cache_alloc_node+0x18e/0x720\n    [00000000147a3f9c>] kmalloc_node_trace+0x2a/0x130\n    [000000004e107011>] io_wq_create+0x7b9/0xdc0\n    [00000000c38b2018>] io_uring_alloc_task_context+0x31e/0x59d\n    [00000000867399da>] __io_uring_add_tctx_node.cold+0x19/0x1ba\n    [000000007e0e7a79>] io_uring_setup.cold+0x1b80/0x1dce\n    [00000000b545e9f6>] __x64_sys_io_uring_setup+0x5d/0x80\n    [000000008a8a7508>] do_syscall_64+0x5d/0x90\n    [000000004ac08bec>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50639</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2022-50639</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2022-50640 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nmmc core Fix kernel panic whe...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nmmc core Fix kernel panic when remove non-standard SDIO card\n\nSDIO tuple is only allocated for standard SDIO card, especially it causes\nmemory corruption issues when the non-standard SDIO card has removed, which\nis because the card device's reference counter does not increase for it at\nsdio_init_func(), but all SDIO card device reference counter gets decreased\nat sdio_release_func(). | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50640</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2022-50640</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2022-50641 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nHSI omap_ssi Fix refcount lea...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nHSI omap_ssi Fix refcount leak in ssi_probe\n\nWhen returning or breaking early from a\nfor_each_available_child_of_node() loop, we need to explicitly call\nof_node_put() on the child node to possibly release the node. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50641</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2022-50641</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2022-50642 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nplatform/chrome cros_ec_typec...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nplatform/chrome cros_ec_typec zero out stale pointers\n\n`cros_typec_get_switch_handles` allocates four pointers when obtaining\ntype-c switch handles.

The next insn to explore is set to\nstart of subprog and the exit from nested frame is handled using\ncurframe > 0 and prepare_func_exit. In case of async callback it uses a\ncustomized variant of push_stack simulating a kind of branch to set up\ncustom state and execution context for the async callback.\n\nWhile this approach is simple and works when callback really will be\nexecuted only once, it is unsafe for all of our current helpers which\nare for_each style, i.e. they execute the callback multiple times.\n\nA callback releasing acquired references of the caller may do so\nmultiple times, but currently verifier sees it as one call inside the\nframe, which then returns to caller. Hence, it thinks it released some\nreference that the cb e.g. got access through callback_ctx (register\nfilled inside cb from spilled typed register on stack).\n\nSimilarly, it may see that an acquire call is unpaired inside the\ncallback, so the caller will copy the reference state of callback and\nthen will have to release the register with new ref_obj_ids. But again,\nthe callback may execute multiple times, but the verifier will only\naccount for acquired references for a single symbolic execution of the\ncallback, which will cause leaks.\n\nNote that for async callback case, things are different. While currently\nwe have bpf_timer_set_callback which only executes it once, even for\nmultiple executions it would be safe, as reference state is NULL and\ncheck_reference_leak would force program to release state before\nBPF_EXIT. The state is also unaffected by analysis for the caller frame.\nHence async callback is safe.\n\nSince we want the reference state to be accessible, e.g. for pointers\nloaded from stack through callback_ctx's PTR_TO_STACK, we still have to\ncopy caller's reference_state to callback's bpf_func_state, but we\nenforce that whatever references it adds to that reference_state has\nbeen released before it hits BPF_EXIT. This requires introducing a new\ncallback_ref member in the reference state to distinguish between caller\nvs callee references. Hence, check_reference_leak now errors out if it\nsees we are in callback_fn and we have not released callback_ref refs.\nSince there can be multiple nested callbacks, like frame 0 -> cb1 -> cb2\netc. we need to also distinguish between whether this particular ref\nbelongs to this callback frame or parent, and only error for our own, so\nwe store state->frameno (which is always non-zero for callbacks).\n\nIn short, callbacks can read parent reference_state, but cannot mutate\nit, to be able to use pointers acquired by the caller. They must only\nundo their changes (by releasing their own acquired_refs before\nBPF_EXIT) on top of caller reference_state before returning (at which\npoint the caller and callback state will match anyway, so no need to\ncopy it back to caller). | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50650</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2022-50650</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2022-50651 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nethtool eeprom fix null-deref...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nethtool eeprom fix null-deref on genl_info in dump\n\nThe similar fix as commit 46cdedf2a0fa (\"ethtool pse-pd fix null-deref on\ngenl_info in dump\") is also needed for ethtool eeprom. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50651</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2022-50651</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2022-50652 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nuio uio_dmem_genirq Fix missi...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nuio uio_dmem_genirq Fix missing unlock in irq configuration\n\nCommit b74351287d4b (\"uio fix a sleep-in-atomic-context bug in\nuio_dmem_genirq_irqcontrol()\") started calling disable_irq() without\nholding the spinlock because it can sleep.

As a\nconsequence, the corresponding file pages will remain locked forever.\n\nIt can be _only_ observed on data-deduplicated compressed images.\nFor example, consider two chains with five pclusters in total\n\tChain 1  2->3->4->5    -- The tail pcluster is 5\n        Chain 2  5->1->2       -- The tail pcluster is 2.\n\nChain 2 could link to Chain 1 with pcluster 5 and Chain 1 could link\nto Chain 2 at the same time with pcluster 2.\n\nSince hooked chains are all linked locklessly now, I have no idea how\nto simply avoid the race.  Instead, let's avoid hooked chains completely\nuntil I could work out a proper way to fix this and end users finally\ntell us that it's needed to add it back.\n\nActually, this optimization can be found with multi-threaded workloads\n(especially even more often on deduplicated compressed images), yet I'm\nnot sure about the overall system impacts of not having this compared\nwith implementation complexity. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53777</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53777</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2023-53778 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\naccel/qaic Clean up integer ov...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\naccel/qaic Clean up integer overflow checking in map_user_pages()\n\nThe encode_dma() function has some validation on in_trans->size but it\nwould be more clear to move those checks to find_and_map_user_pages().\n\nThe encode_dma() had two checks\n\n\tif (in_trans->addr + in_trans->size  in_trans->addr || !in_trans->size)\n\t\treturn -EINVAL\n\nThe in_trans->addr variable is the starting address.  The in_trans->size\nvariable is the total size of the transfer.  The transfer can occur in\nparts and the resources->xferred_dma_size tracks how many bytes we have\nalready transferred.\n\nThis patch introduces a new variable \"remaining\" which represents the\namount we want to transfer (in_trans->size) minus the amount we have\nalready transferred (resources->xferred_dma_size).\n\nI have modified the check for if in_trans->size is zero to instead check\nif in_trans->size is less than resources->xferred_dma_size.  If we have\nalready transferred more bytes than in_trans->size then there are negative\nbytes remaining which doesn't make sense.  If there are zero bytes\nremaining to be copied, just return success.\n\nThe check in encode_dma() checked that \"addr + size\" could not overflow\nand barring a driver bug that should work, but it's easier to check if\nwe do this in parts.  First check that \"in_trans->addr +\nresources->xferred_dma_size\" is safe.  Then check that \"xfer_start_addr +\nremaining\" is safe.\n\nMy final concern was that we are dealing with u64 values but on 32bit\nsystems the kmalloc() function will truncate the sizes to 32 bits.

This assumption\ntypically is satisfied when the skb was allocated in the net core for\ntransmission via the mt7921 netdev (although even that is only an\noptimization and is not strictly guaranteed), but the assumption is\nsometimes not satisfied when the skb originated in the receive path of\nanother netdev and was passed through to the mt7921, such as by the\nbridge layer. Blindly prepending bytes to an skb is always wrong.\n\nThis commit introduces a call to skb_cow_head() before the call to\nmt7921_usb_sdio_write_txwi() in mt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb() to\nensure that at least MT_SDIO_TXD_SIZE + MT_SDIO_HDR_SIZE bytes can be\npushed onto the skb.\n\nWithout this fix, I can trivially cause kernel panics by bridging an\nMT7921AU-based USB 802.11ax interface with an Ethernet interface on an\nIntel Atom-based x86 system using its onboard RTL8169 PCI Ethernet\nadapter and also on an ARM-based Raspberry Pi 1 using its onboard\nSMSC9512 USB Ethernet adapter. Note that the panics do not occur in\nevery system configuration, as they occur only if the receiving netdev\nleaves less headroom in its received skbs than the mt7921 needs for its\nSDIO headers.\n\nHere is an example stack trace of this panic on Raspberry Pi OS Lite\n2023-02-21 running kernel 6.1.24+ [1]\n\n skb_panic from skb_push+0x44/0x48\n skb_push from mt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb+0xd4/0x190 [mt7921_common]\n mt7921_usb_sdio_tx_prepare_skb [mt7921_common] from mt76u_tx_queue_skb+0x94/0x1d0 [mt76_usb]\n mt76u_tx_queue_skb [mt76_usb] from __mt76_tx_queue_skb+0x4c/0xc8 [mt76]\n __mt76_tx_queue_skb [mt76] from mt76_txq_schedule.part.0+0x13c/0x398 [mt76]\n mt76_txq_schedule.part.0 [mt76] from mt76_txq_schedule_all+0x24/0x30 [mt76]\n mt76_txq_schedule_all [mt76] from mt7921_tx_worker+0x58/0xf4 [mt7921_common]\n mt7921_tx_worker [mt7921_common] from __mt76_worker_fn+0x9c/0xec [mt76]\n __mt76_worker_fn [mt76] from kthread+0xbc/0xe0\n kthread from ret_from_fork+0x14/0x34\n\nAfter this fix, bridging the mt7921 interface works fine on both of my\npreviously problematic systems.\n\n[1] https//github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/5c276f55a4b21345cd4d6200a504ee991851ff7a | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53785</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53785</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2023-53786 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ndm flakey fix a crash with inv...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ndm flakey fix a crash with invalid table line\n\nThis command will crash with NULL pointer dereference\n dmsetup create flakey --table \\\n  \"0 `blockdev --getsize /dev/ram0` flakey /dev/ram0 0 0 1 2 corrupt_bio_byte 512\"\n\nFix the crash by checking if arg_name is non-NULL before comparing it. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53786</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53786</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2023-53787 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nregulator da9063 fix null poi...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nregulator da9063 fix null pointer deref with partial DT config\n\nWhen some of the da9063 regulators do not have corresponding DT nodes\na null pointer dereference occurs on boot because such regulators have\nno init_data causing the pointers calculated in\nda9063_check_xvp_constraints() to be invalid.\n\nDo not dereference them in this case. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53787</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53787</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2023-53788 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nALSA hda/ca0132 fixup buffer ...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nALSA hda/ca0132 fixup buffer overrun at tuning_ctl_set()\n\ntuning_ctl_set() might have buffer overrun at (X) if it didn't break\nfrom loop by matching (A).\n\n\tstatic int tuning_ctl_set(...)\n\t{\n\t\tfor (i = 0 i  TUNING_CTLS_COUNT i++)\n(A)\t\t\tif (nid == ca0132_tuning_ctls[i].nid)\n\t\t\t\tbreak\n\n\t\tsnd_hda_power_up(...)\n(X)\t\tdspio_set_param(..., ca0132_tuning_ctls[i].mid, ...)\n\t\tsnd_hda_power_down(...)                ^\n\n\t\treturn 1\n\t}\n\nWe will get below error by cppcheck\n\n\tsound/pci/hda/patch_ca0132.c42292 note After for loop, i has value 12\n\t for (i = 0 i  TUNING_CTLS_COUNT i++)\n\t ^\n\tsound/pci/hda/patch_ca0132.c423443 note Array index out of bounds\n\t dspio_set_param(codec, ca0132_tuning_ctls[i].mid, 0x20,\n\t                                           ^\nThis patch cares non match case. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53788</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53788</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2023-53789 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\niommu/amd Improve page fault e...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\niommu/amd Improve page fault error reporting\n\nIf IOMMU domain for device group is not setup properly then we may hit\nIOMMU page fault.

The int type does not offer\nenough space to store these values, and attempting to use it is a\nrecipe for problems. In this particular case, overflows would occur\nwhen calculating/storing timestamps leading to incorrect values being\nreported to userspace.

Since 'struct\nethtool_link_ksettings' is not initialized in this path, drivers receive\nan uninitialized number of lanes in 'struct\nethtool_link_ksettingslanes'.\n\nWhen this information is later queried from drivers, it results in the\nethtool code making decisions based on uninitialized memory, leading to\nthe following KMSAN splat [1]. In practice, this most likely only\nhappens with the tun driver that simply returns whatever it got in the\nset operation.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this uninitialized memory is not leaked to user\nspace thanks to the 'ethtool_ops->cap_link_lanes_supported' check in\nlinkmodes_prepare_data().\n\nFix by initializing the structure in the IOCTL path. Did not find any\nmore call sites that pass an uninitialized structure when calling\n'ethtool_opsset_link_ksettings()'.\n\n[1]\nBUG KMSAN uninit-value in ethnl_update_linkmodes net/ethtool/linkmodes.c273 [inline]\nBUG KMSAN uninit-value in ethnl_set_linkmodes+0x190b/0x19d0 net/ethtool/linkmodes.c333\n ethnl_update_linkmodes net/ethtool/linkmodes.c273 [inline]\n ethnl_set_linkmodes+0x190b/0x19d0 net/ethtool/linkmodes.c333\n ethnl_default_set_doit+0x88d/0xde0 net/ethtool/netlink.c640\n genl_family_rcv_msg_doit net/netlink/genetlink.c968 [inline]\n genl_family_rcv_msg net/netlink/genetlink.c1048 [inline]\n genl_rcv_msg+0x141a/0x14c0 net/netlink/genetlink.c1065\n netlink_rcv_skb+0x3f8/0x750 net/netlink/af_netlink.c2577\n genl_rcv+0x40/0x60 net/netlink/genetlink.c1076\n netlink_unicast_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c1339 [inline]\n netlink_unicast+0xf41/0x1270 net/netlink/af_netlink.c1365\n netlink_sendmsg+0x127d/0x1430 net/netlink/af_netlink.c1942\n sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c724 [inline]\n sock_sendmsg net/socket.c747 [inline]\n ____sys_sendmsg+0xa24/0xe40 net/socket.c2501\n ___sys_sendmsg+0x2a1/0x3f0 net/socket.c2555\n __sys_sendmsg net/socket.c2584 [inline]\n __do_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c2593 [inline]\n __se_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c2591 [inline]\n __x64_sys_sendmsg+0x36b/0x540 net/socket.c2591\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c50 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0x41/0xc0 arch/x86/entry/common.c80\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd\n\nUninit was stored to memory at\n tun_get_link_ksettings+0x37/0x60 drivers/net/tun.c3544\n __ethtool_get_link_ksettings+0x17b/0x260 net/ethtool/ioctl.c441\n ethnl_set_linkmodes+0xee/0x19d0 net/ethtool/linkmodes.c327\n ethnl_default_set_doit+0x88d/0xde0 net/ethtool/netlink.c640\n genl_family_rcv_msg_doit net/netlink/genetlink.c968 [inline]\n genl_family_rcv_msg net/netlink/genetlink.c1048 [inline]\n genl_rcv_msg+0x141a/0x14c0 net/netlink/genetlink.c1065\n netlink_rcv_skb+0x3f8/0x750 net/netlink/af_netlink.c2577\n genl_rcv+0x40/0x60 net/netlink/genetlink.c1076\n netlink_unicast_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c1339 [inline]\n netlink_unicast+0xf41/0x1270 net/netlink/af_netlink.c1365\n netlink_sendmsg+0x127d/0x1430 net/netlink/af_netlink.c1942\n sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c724 [inline]\n sock_sendmsg net/socket.c747 [inline]\n ____sys_sendmsg+0xa24/0xe40 net/socket.c2501\n ___sys_sendmsg+0x2a1/0x3f0 net/socket.c2555\n __sys_sendmsg net/socket.c2584 [inline]\n __do_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c2593 [inline]\n __se_sys_sendmsg net/socket.c2591 [inline]\n __x64_sys_sendmsg+0x36b/0x540 net/socket.c2591\n do_syscall_x64 arch/x86/entry/common.c50 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0x41/0xc0 arch/x86/entry/common.c80\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd\n\nUninit was stored to memory at\n tun_set_link_ksettings+0x37/0x60 drivers/net/tun.c3553\n ethtool_set_link_ksettings+0x600/0x690 net/ethtool/ioctl.c609\n __dev_ethtool net/ethtool/ioctl.c3024 [inline]\n dev_ethtool+0x1db9/0x2a70 net/ethtool/ioctl.c3078\n dev_ioctl+0xb07/0x1270 net/core/dev_ioctl.c524\n sock_do_ioctl+0x295/0x540 net/socket.c1213\n sock_i\n---truncated--- | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53798</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53798</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2023-53799 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ncrypto api - Use work queue in...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ncrypto api - Use work queue in crypto_destroy_instance\n\nThe function crypto_drop_spawn expects to be called in process\ncontext.

However, the block layer currently doesn't call\nblk_crypto_put_keyslot() until the request is being freed, which happens\nafter upper layers have been told (via bio_endio()) the I/O has\ncompleted.  This causes a race condition where blk_crypto_evict_key()\ncan see 'slot_refs != 0' without there being an actual bug.\n\nThis makes __blk_crypto_evict_key() hit the\n'WARN_ON_ONCE(atomic_read(slot->slot_refs) != 0)' and return without\ndoing anything, eventually causing a use-after-free in\nblk_crypto_reprogram_all_keys().

This was\nleading to a BUG_ON() being hit [1] when we missed a PA that could satisfy\nour request and ultimately tried to create a new PA that would overlap\nwith the missed one.\n\nTo makes sure we handle that case while still keeping the performance of\nthe rbtree, we make use of the fact that the only pa that could possibly\noverlap the original goal start is the one that satisfies the below\nconditions\n\n  1. It must have it's logical start immediately to the left of\n  (ie less than) original logical start.\n\n  2. It must not be deleted\n\nTo find this pa we use the following traversal method\n\n1. Descend into the rbtree normally to find the immediate neighboring\nPA. Here we keep descending irrespective of if the PA is deleted or if\nit overlaps with our request etc. The goal is to find an immediately\nadjacent PA.\n\n2. If the found PA is on right of original goal, use rb_prev() to find\nthe left adjacent PA.\n\n3. Check if this PA is deleted and keep moving left with rb_prev() until\na non deleted PA is found.\n\n4. This is the PA we are looking for. Now we can check if it can satisfy\nthe original request and proceed accordingly.\n\nThis approach also takes care of having deleted PAs in the tree.\n\n(While we are at it, also fix a possible overflow bug in calculating the\nend of a PA)\n\n[1] https//lore.kernel.org/linux-ext4/CA+G9fYv2FRpLqBZf34ZinR8bU2_ZRAUOjKAD3+tKRFaEQHtt8Q@mail.gmail.com/ | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53813</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53813</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2023-53814 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nPCI Fix dropping valid root bu...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nPCI Fix dropping valid root bus resources with .end = zero\n\nOn r8a7791/koelsch\n\n  kmemleak 1 new suspected memory leaks (see /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak)\n  # cat /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak\n  unreferenced object 0xc3a34e00 (size 64)\n    comm \"swapper/0\", pid 1, jiffies 4294937460 (age 199.080s)\n    hex dump (first 32 bytes)\n      b4 5d 81 f0 b4 5d 81 f0 c0 b0 a2 c3 00 00 00 00  .]...]..........\n      00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\n    backtrace\n      [fe3aa979>] __kmalloc+0xf0/0x140\n      [34bd6bc0>] resource_list_create_entry+0x18/0x38\n      [767046bc>] pci_add_resource_offset+0x20/0x68\n      [b3f3edf2>] devm_of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources.constprop.0+0xb0/0x390\n\nWhen coalescing two resources for a contiguous aperture, the second\nresource is enlarged to cover the full contiguous range, while the first\nresource is marked invalid.

This flaw leaves \r\nthe application vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks\r\n an attacker who tricks a logged-in user into visiting a malicious \r\nwebsite could cause the user’s browser to issue GET requests that \r\nperform unintended state-changing operations in the context of their \r\nauthenticated session.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the server would treat these GET requests as valid (since no \r\nCSRF protection or POST method enforcement was in place), the attacker \r\ncould exploit this to escalate privileges, change settings, or carry out\r\n other unauthorized actions without needing the user’s explicit consent \r\nor awareness. \r\nThe fix ensures that all state-changing endpoints now require HTTP POST \r\nrequests and include a valid CSRF token.
