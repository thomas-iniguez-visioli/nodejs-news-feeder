overrun handling\n\nThe receive error handling code is shared between RSCI and all other\nSCIF port types, but the RSCI overrun_reg is specified as a memory\noffset, while for other SCIF types it is an enum value used to index\ninto the sci_port_params->regs array, as mentioned above the\nsci_serial_in() function.\n\nFor RSCI, the overrun_reg is CSR (0x48), causing the sci_getreg() call\ninside the sci_handle_fifo_overrun() function to index outside the\nbounds of the regs array, which currently has a size of 20, as specified\nby SCI_NR_REGS.\n\nBecause of this, we end up accessing memory outside of RSCI's\nrsci_port_params structure, which, when interpreted as a plat_sci_reg,\nhappens to have a non-zero size, causing the following WARN when\nsci_serial_in() is called, as the accidental size does not match the\nsupported register sizes.\n\nThe existence of the overrun_reg needs to be checked because\nSCIx_SH3_SCIF_REGTYPE has overrun_reg set to SCLSR, but SCLSR is not\npresent in the regs array.\n\nAvoid calling sci_getreg() for port types which don't use standard\nregister handling.\n\nUse the ops->read_reg() and ops->write_reg() functions to properly read\nand write registers for RSCI, and change the type of the status variable\nto accommodate the 32-bit CSR register.\n\nsci_getreg() and sci_serial_in() are also called with overrun_reg in the\nsci_mpxed_interrupt() interrupt handler, but that code path is not used\nfor RSCI, as it does not have a muxed interrupt.\n\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nInvalid register access\nWARNING

hdm_disconnect\n\nhdm_disconnect() calls most_deregister_interface(), which eventually\nunregisters the MOST interface device with device_unregister(iface->dev).\nIf that drops the last reference, the device core may call release_mdev()\nimmediately while hdm_disconnect() is still executing.\n\nThe old code also freed several mdev-owned allocations in\nhdm_disconnect() and then performed additional put_device() calls.\nDepending on refcount order, this could lead to use-after-free or\ndouble-free when release_mdev() ran (or when unregister paths also\nperformed puts).\n\nFix by moving the frees of mdev-owned allocations into release_mdev(),\nso they happen exactly once when the device is truly released, and by\ndropping the extra put_device() calls in hdm_disconnect() that are\nredundant after device_unregister() and most_deregister_interface().\n\nThis addresses the KASAN slab-use-after-free reported by syzbot in\nhdm_disconnect(). See report and stack traces in the bug link below. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40223</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-40223</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-40224 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nhwmon (cgbc-hwmon) Add missing...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nhwmon (cgbc-hwmon) Add missing NULL check after devm_kzalloc()\n\nThe driver allocates memory for sensor data using devm_kzalloc(), but\ndid not check if the allocation succeeded.

The splitting\nprocess employs a mechanism, implemented in\ntry_to_map_unused_to_zeropage(), which reads the pages in the THP to\nidentify zero-filled pages.  However, reading the pages in the THP results\nin a second in-kernel #MC, occurring before the initial memory_failure()\ncompletes, ultimately leading to a kernel panic.  See the kernel panic\ncall trace on the two #MCs.\n\n  First Machine Check occurs // [1]\n    memory_failure()         // [2]\n      try_to_split_thp_page()\n        split_huge_page()\n          split_huge_page_to_list_to_order()\n            __folio_split()  // [3]\n              remap_page()\n                remove_migration_ptes()\n                  remove_migration_pte()\n                    try_to_map_unused_to_zeropage()  // [4]\n                      memchr_inv()                   // [5]\n                        Second Machine Check occurs  // [6]\n                          Kernel panic\n\n[1] Triggered by accessing a hardware-poisoned THP in userspace, which is\n    typically recoverable by terminating the affected process.\n\n[2] Call folio_set_has_hwpoisoned() before try_to_split_thp_page().\n\n[3] Pass the RMP_USE_SHARED_ZEROPAGE remap flag to remap_page().\n\n[4] Try to map the unused THP to zeropage.\n\n[5] Re-access pages in the hw-poisoned THP in the kernel.\n\n[6] Triggered in-kernel, leading to a panic kernel.\n\nIn Step[2], memory_failure() sets the poisoned flag on the page in the THP\nby TestSetPageHWPoison() before calling try_to_split_thp_page().\n\nAs suggested by David Hildenbrand, fix this panic by not accessing to the\npoisoned page in the THP during zeropage identification, while continuing\nto scan unaffected pages in the THP for possible zeropage mapping.

During this window, if another thread hold\nvsock_register_mutex while trying to acquire sk_lock, a circular\ndependency is created.\n\nFix this by releasing vsock_register_mutex before calling\ntransport->release() and vsock_deassign_transport(). This is safe\nbecause we don't need to hold vsock_register_mutex while releasing the\nold transport, and we ensure the new transport won't disappear by\nobtaining a module reference first via try_module_get(). | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40231</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-40231</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-40232 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nrv Fully convert enabled_monit...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nrv Fully convert enabled_monitors to use list_head as iterator\n\nThe callbacks in enabled_monitors_seq_ops are inconsistent.

The extent map cache is not invalidated after the move\n6. Later write() operations read stale cached flags (0x2) but disk has\n   updated flags (0x0), causing a mismatch\n7. BUG_ON(!(rec->e_flags  OCFS2_EXT_REFCOUNTED)) triggers\n\nFix by clearing the extent map cache after each extent move/defrag\noperation in __ocfs2_move_extents_range().  This ensures subsequent\noperations read fresh extent data from disk. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40233</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-40233</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-40234 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nplatform/x86 alienware-wmi-wma...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nplatform/x86 alienware-wmi-wmax Fix NULL pointer dereference in sleep handlers\n\nDevices without the AWCC interface don't initialize `awcc`.

This results in a permanently elevated\n   `vvs->bytes_unsent`. Which, in turn, confuses the SOCK_LINGER handling.\n\n2. connect() resetting a connected socket's state may race with socket\n   being placed in a sockmap. A disconnected socket remaining in a sockmap\n   breaks sockmap's assumptions. And gives rise to WARNs.\n\n3. connect() transitioning SS_CONNECTED -> SS_UNCONNECTED allows for a\n   transport change/drop after TCP_ESTABLISHED. Which poses a problem for\n   any simultaneous sendmsg() or connect() and may result in a\n   use-after-free/null-ptr-deref.\n\nDo not disconnect socket on signal/timeout. Keep the logic for unconnected\nsockets they don't linger, can't be placed in a sockmap, are rejected by\nsendmsg().\n\n[1] https//lore.kernel.org/netdev/e07fd95c-9a38-4eea-9638-133e38c2ec9b@rbox.co/\n[2] https//lore.kernel.org/netdev/20250317-vsock-trans-signal-race-v4-0-fc8837f3f1d4@rbox.co/\n[3] https//lore.kernel.org/netdev/60f1b7db-3099-4f6a-875e-af9f6ef194f6@rbox.co/ | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40248</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-40248</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-40249 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ngpio cdev make sure the cdev ...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\ngpio cdev make sure the cdev fd is still active before emitting events\n\nWith the final call to fput() on a file descriptor, the release action\nmay be deferred and scheduled on a work queue.

In addition, this is\ninconsistent with the behavior of `devlink_nl_rate_parent_node_set`,\nwhere the parent pointer is correctly cleared.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue by explicitly setting `devlink_rate->parent`\nto NULL after notifying the driver, thus fulfilling the function's\ndocumented behavior for all rate objects.\n\n[1]\nrepro steps\necho 1 > /sys/bus/netdevsim/new_device\ndevlink dev eswitch set netdevsim/netdevsim1 mode switchdev\necho 1 > /sys/bus/netdevsim/devices/netdevsim1/sriov_numvfs\ndevlink port function rate add netdevsim/netdevsim1/test_node\ndevlink port function rate set netdevsim/netdevsim1/128 parent test_node\necho 1 > /sys/bus/netdevsim/del_device\n\ndmesg\nrefcount_t decrement hit 0 leaking memory.\nWARNING CPU 8 PID 1530 at lib/refcount.c31 refcount_warn_saturate+0x42/0xe0\nCPU 8 UID 0 PID 1530 Comm bash Not tainted 6.18.0-rc4+ #1 NONE\nHardware name QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nRIP 0010refcount_warn_saturate+0x42/0xe0\nCall Trace\n TASK>\n devl_rate_leaf_destroy+0x8d/0x90\n __nsim_dev_port_del+0x6c/0x70 [netdevsim]\n nsim_dev_reload_destroy+0x11c/0x140 [netdevsim]\n nsim_drv_remove+0x2b/0xb0 [netdevsim]\n device_release_driver_internal+0x194/0x1f0\n bus_remove_device+0xc6/0x130\n device_del+0x159/0x3c0\n device_unregister+0x1a/0x60\n del_device_store+0x111/0x170 [netdevsim]\n kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x12e/0x1e0\n vfs_write+0x215/0x3d0\n ksys_write+0x5f/0xd0\n do_syscall_64+0x55/0x10f0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\n\n[2]\ndevlink dev eswitch set pci/00000800.0 mode switchdev\ndevlink port add pci/00000800.0 flavour pcisf pfnum 0 sfnum 1000\ndevlink port function rate add pci/00000800.0/group1\ndevlink port function rate set pci/00000800.0/32768 parent group1\nmodprobe -r mlx5_ib mlx5_fwctl mlx5_core\n\ndmesg\nrefcount_t decrement hit 0 leaking memory.\nWARNING CPU 7 PID 16151 at lib/refcount.c31 refcount_warn_saturate+0x42/0xe0\nCPU 7 UID 0 PID 16151 Comm bash Not tainted 6.17.0-rc7_for_upstream_min_debug_2025_10_02_12_44 #1 NONE\nHardware name QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS rel-1.16.3-0-ga6ed6b701f0a-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nRIP 0010refcount_warn_saturate+0x42/0xe0\nCall Trace\n TASK>\n devl_rate_leaf_destroy+0x8d/0x90\n mlx5_esw_offloads_devlink_port_unregister+0x33/0x60 [mlx5_core]\n mlx5_esw_offloads_unload_rep+0x3f/0x50 [mlx5_core]\n mlx5_eswitch_unload_sf_vport+0x40/0x90 [mlx5_core]\n mlx5_sf_esw_event+0xc4/0x120 [mlx5_core]\n notifier_call_chain+0x33/0xa0\n blocking_notifier_call_chain+0x3b/0x50\n mlx5_eswitch_disable_locked+0x50/0x110 [mlx5_core]\n mlx5_eswitch_disable+0x63/0x90 [mlx5_core]\n mlx5_unload+0x1d/0x170 [mlx5_core]\n mlx5_uninit_one+0xa2/0x130 [mlx5_core]\n remove_one+0x78/0xd0 [mlx5_core]\n pci_device_remove+0x39/0xa0\n device_release_driver_internal+0x194/0x1f0\n unbind_store+0x99/0xa0\n kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x12e/0x1e0\n vfs_write+0x215/0x3d0\n ksys_write+0x5f/0xd0\n do_syscall_64+0x53/0x1f0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53 | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40251</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-40251</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-40252 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nnet qlogic/qede fix potential...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nnet qlogic/qede fix potential out-of-bounds read in qede_tpa_cont() and qede_tpa_end()\n\nThe loops in 'qede_tpa_cont()' and 'qede_tpa_end()', iterate\nover 'cqe->len_list[]' using only a zero-length terminator as\nthe stopping condition.

However, the set(nsh(...)) has a very different\nmemory layout.  Nested attributes in there are doubled in size in\ncase of the masked set().  That makes proper validation impossible.\n\nThere is also confusion in the code between the 'masked' flag, that\nsays that the nested attributes are doubled in size containing both\nthe value and the mask, and the 'is_mask' that says that the value\nwe're parsing is the mask.  This is causing kernel crash on trying to\nwrite into mask part of the match with SW_FLOW_KEY_PUT() during\nvalidation, while validate_nsh() doesn't allocate any memory for it\n\n  BUG kernel NULL pointer dereference, address 0000000000000018\n  #PF supervisor read access in kernel mode\n  #PF error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n  PGD 1c2383067 P4D 1c2383067 PUD 20b703067 PMD 0\n  Oops Oops 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI\n  CPU 8 UID 0 Kdump loaded Not tainted 6.17.0-rc4+ #107 PREEMPT(voluntary)\n  RIP 0010nsh_key_put_from_nlattr+0x19d/0x610 [openvswitch]\n  Call Trace\n   TASK>\n   validate_nsh+0x60/0x90 [openvswitch]\n   validate_set.constprop.0+0x270/0x3c0 [openvswitch]\n   __ovs_nla_copy_actions+0x477/0x860 [openvswitch]\n   ovs_nla_copy_actions+0x8d/0x100 [openvswitch]\n   ovs_packet_cmd_execute+0x1cc/0x310 [openvswitch]\n   genl_family_rcv_msg_doit+0xdb/0x130\n   genl_family_rcv_msg+0x14b/0x220\n   genl_rcv_msg+0x47/0xa0\n   netlink_rcv_skb+0x53/0x100\n   genl_rcv+0x24/0x40\n   netlink_unicast+0x280/0x3b0\n   netlink_sendmsg+0x1f7/0x430\n   ____sys_sendmsg+0x36b/0x3a0\n   ___sys_sendmsg+0x87/0xd0\n   __sys_sendmsg+0x6d/0xd0\n   do_syscall_64+0x7b/0x2c0\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n\nThe third issue with this process is that while trying to convert\nthe non-masked set into masked one, validate_set() copies and doubles\nthe size of the OVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH as if it didn't have any nested\nattributes.  It should be copying each nested attribute and doubling\nthem in size independently.  And the process must be properly reversed\nduring the conversion back from masked to a non-masked variant during\nthe flow dump.\n\nIn the end, the only two outcomes of trying to use this action are\neither validation failure or a kernel crash.  And if somehow someone\nmanages to install a flow with such an action, it will most definitely\nnot do what it is supposed to, since all the keys and the masks are\nmixed up.\n\nFixing all the issues is a complex task as it requires re-writing\nmost of the validation code.\n\nGiven that and the fact that this functionality never worked since\nintroduction, let's just remove it altogether.  It's better to\nre-introduce it later with a proper implementation instead of trying\nto fix it in stable releases. | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40254</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-40254</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>CVE-2025-40255 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nnet core prevent NULL deref i...</title>\n      <description>In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\n\nnet core prevent NULL deref in generic_hwtstamp_ioctl_lower()\n\nThe ethtool tsconfig Netlink path can trigger a null pointer\ndereference.

The user state doesn't go through __xfrm_state_delete, so we\ndon't call xfrm_state_delete_tunnel for those states, and we end up\nleaking the FB tunnel.\n\nThere are several codepaths affected by this the add/update paths, in\nboth net/key and xfrm, and the migrate code (xfrm_migrate,\nxfrm_state_migrate). A \"proper\" rollback of the init_state work would\nprobably be doable in the add/update code, but for migrate it gets\nmore complicated as multiple states may be involved.\n\nAt some point, the new (not-inserted) state will be destroyed, so call\nxfrm_state_delete_tunnel during xfrm_state_gc_destroy. Most states\nwill have their fallback tunnel cleaned up during __xfrm_state_delete,\nwhich solves the issue that b441cf3f8c4b (and other patches before it)\naimed at. All states (including FB tunnels) will be removed from the\nlists once xfrm_state_fini has called flush_work(xfrm_state_gc_work). | Severity UNKNOWN  </description>\n      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025

This being the\r\nreverse operation to the hotplug events generated by sriov_enable() and\r\nhandled via pdev->no_vf_scan. And while the event processing takes\r\npci_rescan_remove_lock and checks whether the struct pci_dev still exists,\r\nthe lack of synchronization makes this checking racy.\r\n\r\nOther races may also be possible of course though given that this lack of\r\nlocking persisted so long observable races seem very rare. Even on s390 the\r\nlist corruption was only observed with certain devices since the platform\r\nevents are only triggered by config accesses after the removal, so as long\r\nas the removal finished synchronously they would not race. Either way the\r\nlocking is missing so fix this by adding it to the sriov_del_vfs() helper.\r\n\r\nJust like PCI rescan-remove, locking is also missing in sriov_add_vfs()\r\nincluding for the error case where pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device() is\r\ncalled without the PCI rescan-remove lock being held. Even in the non-error\r\ncase, adding new PCI devices and buses should be serialized via the PCI\r\nrescan-remove lock. Add the necessary locking. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:15:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40219</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-40219</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2025-40220 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nfuse fix livelock in synchrono...</title>\r\n      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nfuse fix livelock in synchronous file put from fuseblk workers\r\n\r\nI observed a hang when running generic/323 against a fuseblk server.\r\nThis test opens a file, initiates a lot of AIO writes to that file\r\ndescriptor, and closes the file descriptor before the writes complete.\r\nUnsurprisingly, the AIO exerciser threads are mostly stuck waiting for\r\nresponses from the fuseblk server\r\n\r\n# cat /proc/372265/task/372313/stack\r\n[0>] request_wait_answer+0x1fe/0x2a0 [fuse]\r\n[0>] __fuse_simple_request+0xd3/0x2b0 [fuse]\r\n[0>] fuse_do_getattr+0xfc/0x1f0 [fuse]\r\n[0>] fuse_file_read_iter+0xbe/0x1c0 [fuse]\r\n[0>] aio_read+0x130/0x1e0\r\n[0>] io_submit_one+0x542/0x860\r\n[0>] __x64_sys_io_submit+0x98/0x1a0\r\n[0>] do_syscall_64+0x37/0xf0\r\n[0>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\r\n\r\nBut the /weird/ part is that the fuseblk server threads are waiting for\r\nresponses from itself\r\n\r\n# cat /proc/372210/task/372232/stack\r\n[0>] request_wait_answer+0x1fe/0x2a0 [fuse]\r\n[0>] __fuse_simple_request+0xd3/0x2b0 [fuse]\r\n[0>] fuse_file_put+0x9a/0xd0 [fuse]\r\n[0>] fuse_release+0x36/0x50 [fuse]\r\n[0>] __fput+0xec/0x2b0\r\n[0>] task_work_run+0x55/0x90\r\n[0>] syscall_exit_to_user_mode+0xe9/0x100\r\n[0>] do_syscall_64+0x43/0xf0\r\n[0>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\r\n\r\nThe fuseblk server is fuse2fs so there's nothing all that exciting in\r\nthe server itself.

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the network configuration functionality, stemming from insufficient input validation when processing network configuration parameters through administrative endpoints. The application allows administrators to modify the server's network configuration through the Django application. This configuration is processed by Bash scripts (TSsetnoproxy and TSsetproxy) that write user-controlled data directly to environment variables without proper sanitization. After updating environment variables, the scripts execute a source command on /etc/environment if an attacker injects malicious data into environment variables, this command can enable arbitrary command execution. The vulnerability begins with the /admin/network endpoint, which passes user-supplied form data as arguments to subprocess.Popen calls. The user-supplied input is then used to update environment variables in TSsetnoproxy and TSsetproxy, and finally source $environment is executed. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>  ]]>  </description>\r\n      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:15:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54306</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-54306</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2025-54307 An issue was discovered in the Thermo Fisher Torrent Suite Django application 5.18.1.

The plupload_file_upload function handles these file uploads and constructs the destination file path by using either the name parameter or the uploaded filename, neither of which is properly sanitized. The file extension is extracted by splitting the filename, and a format string is used to construct the final file path, leaving the destination path vulnerable to path traversal. An authenticated attacker with network connectivity can write arbitrary files to the server, enabling remote code execution after overwriting an executable file.
