In versions up to and including 0.9-rc2, the simple protocol server ignores the documented client limit and accepts unlimited connections, allowing for easy local DoS. Although `CLIENTS_MAX` is defined, `server_work()` unconditionally `accept()`s and `client_new()` always appends the new client and increments `n_clients`. There is no check against the limit. When client cannot be accepted as a result of maximal socket number of avahi-daemon, it logs unconditionally error per each connection. Unprivileged local users can exhaust daemon memory and file descriptors, causing a denial of service system-wide for mDNS/DNS-SD. Exhausting local file descriptors causes increased system load caused by logging errors of each of request. Overloading prevents glibc calls using nss-mdns plugins to resolve `*.local.` names and link-local addresses. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available, but a candidate fix is available in pull request 808, and some workarounds are available. Simple clients are offered for nss-mdns package functionality. It is not possible to disable the unix socket `/run/avahi-daemon/socket`, but resolution requests received via DBus are not affected directly. Tools avahi-resolve, avahi-resolve-address and avahi-resolve-host-name are not affected, they use DBus interface. It is possible to change permissions of unix socket after avahi-daemon is started. But avahi-daemon does not provide any configuration for it. Additional access restrictions like SELinux can also prevent unwanted tools to access the socket and keep resolution working for trusted users. | CVSS Score 5.5 (MEDIUM)    </description>\r\n      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 21:15:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59529</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-59529</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2025-62000 BullWall Ransomware Containment does not entirely inspect a file to determine if it is ransomware.

An attacker who can send PFCP Session Report Response messages to the UPF's N4/PFCP endpoint can exploit this flaw to repeatedly crash the UPF and disrupt user-plane services. | Severity UNKNOWN          </description>\r\n      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 20:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65566</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-65566</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2025-67163 A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Simple Machines Forum v2.1.6 allows attackers t...</title>\r\n      <description>[[[[A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Simple Machines Forum v2.1.6 allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via injecting a crafted payload into the Forum Name parameter. | Severity UNKNOWN          </description>\r\n      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 20:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67163</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-67163</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2019-25228 An information disclosure vulnerability in Kentico Xperience allows attackers to leak virtual contex...</title>\r\n      <description>[[[[An information disclosure vulnerability in Kentico Xperience allows attackers to leak virtual context URLs via the HTTP Referer header when users interact with third-party domains.

In versions 4.0.8 and prior, the Apache proxy allows sensitive headers to be passed to origin servers. This means malicious users can create an origin server on a compute node that record these headers when unsuspecting users connect to it. Maintainers anticipate a patch in a 4.1 release. Workarounds exist for 4.0.x versions. Using `custom_location_directives` in `ood_portal.yml` in version 4.0.x (not available for versions below 4.0) centers can unset and or edit these headers. Note that `OIDCPassClaimsAs both` is the default and centers can set `OIDCPassClaimsAs ` to `none` or `environment` to stop passing these headers to the client. Centers that have an OIDC provider with the `OIDCPassClaimsAs` with `none` or `environment` settings can adjust the settings using guidance provided in GHSA-2cwp-8g29-9q32 to unset the mod_auth_openidc_session cookies. | CVSS Score 7.6 (HIGH)                                                                                          </description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 23:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66029</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-66029</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2025-68143 Model Context Protocol Servers is a collection of reference implementations for the model context pr...</title>\r\n      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[Model Context Protocol Servers is a collection of reference implementations for the model context protocol (MCP).

Starting in version 3.4.0 and prior to version 3.4.2, a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the \"Return Policy\" configuration field. The application does not properly sanitize user input before saving it to the database or displaying it on receipts. An attacker with access to the \"Store Configuration\" (such as a rogue administrator or an account compromised via the separate CSRF vulnerability) can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into this field. These payloads are executed in the browser of any user (including other administrators and sales staff) whenever they view a receipt or complete a transaction. This can lead to session hijacking, theft of sensitive data, or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim. The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.4.2 by ensuring the output is escaped using the `esc()` function in the receipt template. As a temporary mitigation, administrators should ensure the \"Return Policy\" field contains only plain text and strictly avoid entering any HTML tags. There is no code-based workaround other than applying the patch. | CVSS Score 8.1 (HIGH)                                                                                          </description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 23:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68147</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-68147</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2025-68429 Storybook is a frontend workshop for building user interface components and pages in isolation.

A vulnerability present starting in versions 7.0.0 and prior to versions 7.6.21, 8.6.15, 9.1.17, and 10.1.10 relates to Storybook’s handling of environment variables defined in a `.env` file, which could, in specific circumstances, lead to those variables being unexpectedly bundled into the artifacts created by the `storybook build` command. When a built Storybook is published to the web, the bundle’s source is viewable, thus potentially exposing those variables to anyone with access. For a project to potentially be vulnerable to this issue, it must build the Storybook (i.e. run `storybook build` directly or indirectly) in a directory that contains a `.env` file (including variants like `.env.local`) and publish the built Storybook to the web. Storybooks built without a `.env` file at build time are not affected, including common CI-based builds where secrets are provided via platform environment variables rather than `.env` files. Storybook runtime environments (i.e. `storybook dev`) are not affected. Deployed applications that share a repo with your Storybook are not affected. Users should upgrade their Storybook—on both their local machines and CI environment—to version .6.21, 8.6.15, 9.1.17, or 10.1.10 as soon as possible. Maintainers additionally recommend that users audit for any sensitive secrets provided via `.env` files and rotate those keys. Some projects may have been relying on the undocumented behavior at the heart of this issue and will need to change how they reference environment variables after this update. If a project can no longer read necessary environmental variable values, either prefix the variables with `STORYBOOK_` or use the `env` property in Storybook’s configuration to manually specify values. In either case, do not include sensitive secrets as they will be included in the built bundle. | CVSS Score 7.3 (HIGH)                                                                                          </description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 23:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68429</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-68429</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2025-68432 Zed, a code editor, has an aribtrary code execution vulnerability in versions prior to 0.218.2-pre. ...</title>\r\n      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[Zed, a code editor, has an aribtrary code execution vulnerability in versions prior to 0.218.2-pre.

Starting in version 3.4.0 and prior to version 3.4.2, a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the application's filter configuration. The CSRF protection mechanism was **explicitly disabled**, allowing the application to process state-changing requests (POST) without verifying a valid CSRF token. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious web page. If a logged-in administrator visits this page, their browser is forced to send unauthorized requests to the application. A successful exploit allows the attacker to silently create a new Administrator account with full privileges, leading to a complete takeover of the system and loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.4.2. The fix re-enables the CSRF filter in `app/Config/Filters.php` and resolves associated AJAX race conditions by adjusting token regeneration settings. As a workaround, administrators can manually re-enable the CSRF filter in `app/Config/Filters.php` by uncommenting the protection line. However, this is not recommended without applying the full patch, as it may cause functionality breakage in the Sales module due to token synchronization issues. | CVSS Score 8.8 (HIGH)                                                                                          </description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 23:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68434</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-68434</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2025-68435 Zerobyte is a backup automation tool Zerobyte versions prior to 0.18.5 and 0.19.0 contain an authent...</title>\r\n      <description>[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[Zerobyte is a backup automation tool Zerobyte versions prior to 0.18.5 and 0.19.0 contain an authentication bypass vulnerability where authentication middleware is not properly applied to API endpoints.
