memory leak of urbs in ath9k_hif_usb_dealloc_tx_urbs()\r\n\r\nSyzkaller reports a long-known leak of urbs in\r\nath9k_hif_usb_dealloc_tx_urbs().\r\n\r\nThe cause of the leak is that usb_get_urb() is called but usb_free_urb()\r\n(or usb_put_urb()) is not called inside usb_kill_urb() as urb->dev or\r\nurb->ep fields have not been initialized and usb_kill_urb() returns\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nThe patch removes trying to kill urbs located in hif_dev->tx.tx_buf\r\nbecause hif_dev->tx.tx_buf is not supposed to contain urbs which are in\r\npending state (the pending urbs are stored in hif_dev->tx.tx_pending).\r\nThe tx.tx_lock is acquired so there should not be any changes in the list.\r\n\r\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller. | Severity

This occurs in tests where the input and the output\r\nscatter list point to the same buffers (i.e. two different scatter lists\r\nwhich point to the same chunks of memory).\r\n\r\nThe logic that implements the mapping uses the flag DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL\r\nfor both the input and the output scatter lists which leads to\r\noverlapped write mappings.

For in-place operations where the input scatter list\r\nmatches the output scatter list, buffers are mapped once with\r\nDMA_BIDIRECTIONAL, otherwise input buffers are mapped using the flag\r\nDMA_TO_DEVICE and output buffers are mapped with DMA_FROM_DEVICE.\r\nOverlapping a read mapping with a write mapping is a valid case in\r\ndma-coherent devices like QAT.\r\nThe function that frees and unmaps the buffers, qat_alg_free_bufl()\r\nhas been changed accordingly to the changes to the mapping function.\r\n\r\n   DMA-API 4xxx 00000600.0 cacheline tracking EEXIST, overlapping mappings aren't supported\r\n   WARNING CPU 53 PID 4362 at kernel/dma/debug.c570 add_dma_entry+0x1e9/0x270\r\n   ...\r\n   Call Trace\r\n   dma_map_page_attrs+0x82/0x2d0\r\n   ? preempt_count_add+0x6a/0xa0\r\n   qat_alg_sgl_to_bufl+0x45b/0x990 [intel_qat]\r\n   qat_alg_aead_dec+0x71/0x250 [intel_qat]\r\n   crypto_aead_decrypt+0x3d/0x70\r\n   test_aead_vec_cfg+0x649/0x810\r\n   ? number+0x310/0x3a0\r\n   ? vsnprintf+0x2a3/0x550\r\n   ? scnprintf+0x42/0x70\r\n   ? valid_sg_divisions.constprop.0+0x86/0xa0\r\n   ? test_aead_vec+0xdf/0x120\r\n   test_aead_vec+0xdf/0x120\r\n   alg_test_aead+0x185/0x400\r\n   alg_test+0x3d8/0x500\r\n   ? crypto_acomp_scomp_free_ctx+0x30/0x30\r\n   ? __schedule+0x32a/0x12a0\r\n   ? ttwu_queue_wakelist+0xbf/0x110\r\n   ? _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x23/0x40\r\n   ? try_to_wake_up+0x83/0x570\r\n   ? _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x23/0x40\r\n   ? __set_cpus_allowed_ptr_locked+0xea/0x1b0\r\n   ? crypto_acomp_scomp_free_ctx+0x30/0x30\r\n   cryptomgr_test+0x27/0x50\r\n   kthread+0xe6/0x110\r\n   ? kthread_complete_and_exit+0x20/0x20\r\n   ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30 | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50774</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2022-50774</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2022-50775 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nRDMA/hns Fix refcount leak in ...</title>\r\n      <description>[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nRDMA/hns Fix refcount leak in hns_roce_mmap\r\n\r\nrdma_user_mmap_entry_get_pgoff() takes the reference.\r\nAdd missing rdma_user_mmap_entry_put() to release the reference.\r\n\r\nAcked-by Haoyue Xu xuhaoyue1@hisilicon.com> | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50775</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2022-50775</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2022-50776 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nclk st Fix memory leak in st_...</title>\r\n      <description>[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nclk st Fix memory leak in st_of_quadfs_setup()\r\n\r\nIf st_clk_register_quadfs_pll() fails, @lock should be freed before goto\r\n@err_exit, otherwise will cause meory leak issue, fix it. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50776</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2022-50776</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2022-50777 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nnet phy xgmiitorgmii Fix ref...</title>\r\n      <description>[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nnet phy xgmiitorgmii Fix refcount leak in xgmiitorgmii_probe\r\n\r\nof_phy_find_device() return device node with refcount incremented.\r\nCall put_device() to relese it when not needed anymore. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50777</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2022-50777</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2022-50778 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nfortify Fix __compiletime_strl...</title>\r\n      <description>[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nfortify Fix __compiletime_strlen() under UBSAN_BOUNDS_LOCAL\r\n\r\nWith CONFIG_FORTIFY=y and CONFIG_UBSAN_LOCAL_BOUNDS=y enabled, we observe\r\na runtime panic while running Android's Compatibility Test Suite's (CTS)\r\nandroid.hardware.input.cts.tests. This is stemming from a strlen()\r\ncall in hidinput_allocate().\r\n\r\n__compiletime_strlen() is implemented in terms of __builtin_object_size(),\r\nthen does an array access to check for NUL-termination. A quirk of\r\n__builtin_object_size() is that for strings whose values are runtime\r\ndependent, __builtin_object_size(str, 1 or 0) returns the maximum size\r\nof possible values when those sizes are determinable at compile time.\r\nExample\r\n\r\n  static const char *v = \"FOO BAR\"\r\n  static const char *y = \"FOO BA\"\r\n  unsigned long x (int z) {\r\n      // Returns 8, which is\r\n      // max(__builtin_object_size(v, 1), __builtin_object_size(y, 1))\r\n      return __builtin_object_size(z ? v  y, 1)\r\n  }\r\n\r\nSo when FORTIFY_SOURCE is enabled, the current implementation of\r\n__compiletime_strlen() will try to access beyond the end of y at runtime\r\nusing the size of v. Mixed with UBSAN_LOCAL_BOUNDS we get a fault.\r\n\r\nhidinput_allocate() has a local C string whose value is control flow\r\ndependent on a switch statement, so __builtin_object_size(str, 1)\r\nevaluates to the maximum string length, making all other cases fault on\r\nthe last character check. hidinput_allocate() could be cleaned up to\r\navoid runtime calls to strlen() since the local variable can only have\r\nliteral values, so there's no benefit to trying to fortify the strlen\r\ncall site there.\r\n\r\nPerform a __builtin_constant_p() check against index 0 earlier in the\r\nmacro to filter out the control-flow-dependant case. Add a KUnit test\r\nfor checking the expected behavioral characteristics of FORTIFY_SOURCE\r\ninternals. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50778</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2022-50778</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2022-50779 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\norangefs Fix kmemleak in orang...</title>\r\n      <description>[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\norangefs Fix kmemleak in orangefs_prepare_debugfs_help_string()\r\n\r\nWhen insert and remove the orangefs module, then debug_help_string will\r\nbe leaked\r\n\r\n  unreferenced object 0xffff8881652ba000 (size 4096)\r\n    comm \"insmod\", pid 1701, jiffies 4294893639 (age 13218.530s)\r\n    hex dump (first 32 bytes)\r\n      43 6c 69 65 6e 74 20 44 65 62 75 67 20 4b 65 79  Client Debug Key\r\n      77 6f 72 64 73 20 61 72 65 20 75 6e 6b 6e 6f 77  words are unknow\r\n    backtrace\r\n      [0000000004e6f8e3>] kmalloc_trace+0x27/0xa0\r\n      [0000000006f75d85>] orangefs_prepare_debugfs_help_string+0x5e/0x480 [orangefs]\r\n      [0000000091270a2a>] _sub_I_65535_1+0x57/0xf70 [crc_itu_t]\r\n      [000000004b1ee1a3>] do_one_initcall+0x87/0x2a0\r\n      [000000001d0614ae>] do_init_module+0xdf/0x320\r\n      [00000000efef068c>] load_module+0x2f98/0x3330\r\n      [000000006533b44d>] __do_sys_finit_module+0x113/0x1b0\r\n      [00000000a0da6f99>] do_syscall_64+0x35/0x80\r\n      [000000007790b19b>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x46/0xb0\r\n\r\nWhen remove the module, should always free debug_help_string.

However,\r\nimmediately after this, the rings are reconfigured by ixgbe_setup_tc.\r\nixgbe_setup_tc calls ixgbe_clear_interrupt_scheme which calls\r\nixgbe_free_q_vectors which calls ixgbe_free_q_vector in a loop.\r\nixgbe_free_q_vector decrements ixgbe_xdp_locking_key once per call if\r\nit is non-zero.  Commenting out the decrement in ixgbe_free_q_vector\r\nstopped my system from panicing.\r\n\r\nI suspect to make the original patch work, I would need to load an XDP\r\nprogram and then replace it in order to get ixgbe_xdp_locking_key back\r\nabove 0 since ixgbe_setup_tc is only called when transitioning between\r\nXDP and non-XDP ring configurations, while ixgbe_xdp_locking_key is\r\nincremented every time ixgbe_xdp_setup is called.\r\n\r\nAlso, ixgbe_setup_tc can be called via ethtool --set-channels, so this\r\nbecomes another path to decrement ixgbe_xdp_locking_key to 0 on systems\r\nwith more than 64 CPUs.\r\n\r\nSince ixgbe_xdp_locking_key only protects the XDP_TX path and is tied\r\nto the number of CPUs present, there is no reason to disable it upon\r\nunloading an XDP program.  To avoid confusion, I have moved enabling\r\nixgbe_xdp_locking_key into ixgbe_sw_init, which is part of the probe path. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54090</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-54090</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-54091 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\ndrm/client Fix memory leak in ...</title>\r\n      <description>[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\ndrm/client Fix memory leak in drm_client_target_cloned\r\n\r\ndmt_mode is allocated and never freed in this function.\r\nIt was found with the ast driver, but most drivers using generic fbdev\r\nsetup are probably affected.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the following kmemleak report\r\n  backtrace\r\n    [00000000b391296d>] drm_mode_duplicate+0x45/0x220 [drm]\r\n    [00000000e45bb5b3>] drm_client_target_cloned.constprop.0+0x27b/0x480 [drm]\r\n    [00000000ed2d3a37>] drm_client_modeset_probe+0x6bd/0xf50 [drm]\r\n    [0000000010e5cc9d>] __drm_fb_helper_initial_config_and_unlock+0xb4/0x2c0 [drm_kms_helper]\r\n    [00000000909f82ca>] drm_fbdev_client_hotplug+0x2bc/0x4d0 [drm_kms_helper]\r\n    [00000000063a69aa>] drm_client_register+0x169/0x240 [drm]\r\n    [00000000a8c61525>] ast_pci_probe+0x142/0x190 [ast]\r\n    [00000000987f19bb>] local_pci_probe+0xdc/0x180\r\n    [000000004fca231b>] work_for_cpu_fn+0x4e/0xa0\r\n    [0000000000b85301>] process_one_work+0x8b7/0x1540\r\n    [000000003375b17c>] worker_thread+0x70a/0xed0\r\n    [00000000b0d43cd9>] kthread+0x29f/0x340\r\n    [000000008d770833>] ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\r\nunreferenced object 0xff11000333089a00 (size 128) | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54091</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-54091</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-54092 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nKVM s390 pv fix index value ...</title>\r\n      <description>[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nKVM s390 pv fix index value of replaced ASCE\r\n\r\nThe index field of the struct page corresponding to a guest ASCE should\r\nbe 0.

However during remounting read-only filesystem to read-write\r\nmode userspace writes can start immediately once we clear SB_RDONLY\r\nflag. This is inconvenient for example for ext4 because we need to do\r\nsome writes to the filesystem (such as preparation of quota files)\r\nbefore we can take userspace writes so we are clearing SB_RDONLY flag\r\nbefore we are fully ready to accept userpace writes and syzbot has found\r\na way to exploit this [1]. Also as far as I'm reading the code\r\nthe filesystem remount code was protected from racing writes in the\r\nlegacy mount path by the mount's MNT_READONLY flag so this is relatively\r\nnew problem.

In combination with an already flawed error\r\nhandling in dcssblk (device_register() cleanup), which needs to be\r\naddressed in a separate patch, this resulted in a missing device_del() /\r\nklist_del(), and eventually in the kernel crash with list_add corruption on\r\na subsequent device_add() / klist_add().\r\n\r\nFix this by adding the missing dax_remove_host() calls, and also move the\r\nput_device() in the error path to restore the previous logic. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54117</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-54117</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-54118 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nserial sc16is7xx setup GPIO c...</title>\r\n      <description>[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nserial sc16is7xx setup GPIO controller later in probe\r\n\r\nThe GPIO controller component of the sc16is7xx driver is setup too\r\nearly, which can result in a race condition where another device tries\r\nto utilise the GPIO lines before the sc16is7xx device has finished\r\ninitialising.\r\n\r\nThis issue manifests itself as an Oops when the GPIO lines are configured\r\n\r\n    Unable to handle kernel read from unreadable memory at virtual address\r\n    ...\r\n    pc  sc16is7xx_gpio_direction_output+0x68/0x108 [sc16is7xx]\r\n    lr  sc16is7xx_gpio_direction_output+0x4c/0x108 [sc16is7xx]\r\n    ...\r\n    Call trace\r\n    sc16is7xx_gpio_direction_output+0x68/0x108 [sc16is7xx]\r\n    gpiod_direction_output_raw_commit+0x64/0x318\r\n    gpiod_direction_output+0xb0/0x170\r\n    create_gpio_led+0xec/0x198\r\n    gpio_led_probe+0x16c/0x4f0\r\n    platform_drv_probe+0x5c/0xb0\r\n    really_probe+0xe8/0x448\r\n    driver_probe_device+0xe8/0x138\r\n    __device_attach_driver+0x94/0x118\r\n    bus_for_each_drv+0x8c/0xe0\r\n    __device_attach+0x100/0x1b8\r\n    device_initial_probe+0x28/0x38\r\n    bus_probe_device+0xa4/0xb0\r\n    deferred_probe_work_func+0x90/0xe0\r\n    process_one_work+0x1c4/0x480\r\n    worker_thread+0x54/0x430\r\n    kthread+0x138/0x150\r\n    ret_from_fork+0x10/0x1c\r\n\r\nThis patch moves the setup of the GPIO controller functions to later in the\r\nprobe function, ensuring the sc16is7xx device has already finished\r\ninitialising by the time other devices try to make use of the GPIO lines.\r\nThe error handling has also been reordered to reflect the new\r\ninitialisation order. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54118</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-54118</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-54119 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\ninotify Avoid reporting event ...</title>\r\n      <description>[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\ninotify Avoid reporting event with invalid wd\r\n\r\nWhen inotify_freeing_mark() races with inotify_handle_inode_event() it\r\ncan happen that inotify_handle_inode_event() sees that i_mark->wd got\r\nalready reset to -1 and reports this value to userspace which can\r\nconfuse the inotify listener.

After that wait_event_killable() is interrupted (it returns\r\n-ERESTARTSYS), so that 'wq->name.name == NULL' condition may be not\r\nsatisfied. Actually, this condition can be satisfied when\r\nautofs_wait_release() or autofs_catatonic_mode() is called and, what is\r\nalso important, wait_ctr is decremented in those places. Upon the exit of\r\nautofs_wait(), wait_ctr is decremented to 1. Then the unmounting process\r\nbegins kill_sb calls autofs_catatonic_mode(), which should have freed the\r\nwaitqueues, but it only decrements its usage counter to zero which is not\r\na correct behaviour.\r\n\r\neditimk\r\nThis description is of course not correct. The umount performed as a result\r\nof an expire is a umount of a mount that has been automounted, it's not the\r\nautofs mount itself. They happen independently, usually after everything\r\nmounted within the autofs file system has been expired away. If everything\r\nhasn't been expired away the automount daemon can still exit leaving mounts\r\nin place. But expires done in both cases will result in a notification that\r\ncalls autofs_wait_release() with a result status. The problem case is the\r\nsummary execution of of the automount daemon. In this case any waiting\r\nprocesses won't be woken up until either they are terminated or the mount\r\nis umounted.\r\nend edit imk\r\n\r\nSo in catatonic mode we should free waitqueues which counter becomes zero.\r\n\r\nedit imk\r\nInitially I was concerned that the calling of autofs_wait_release() and\r\nautofs_catatonic_mode() was not mutually exclusive but that can't be the\r\ncase (obviously) because the queue entry (or entries) is removed from the\r\nlist when either of these two functions are called. Consequently the wait\r\nentry will be freed by only one of these functions or by the woken process\r\nin autofs_wait() depending on the order of the calls.\r\nend edit imk | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54134</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-54134</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-54135 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nmaple_tree fix potential out-o...</title>\r\n      <description>[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nmaple_tree fix potential out-of-bounds access in mas_wr_end_piv()\r\n\r\nCheck the write offset end bounds before using it as the offset into the\r\npivot array.

This was just a side effect of that change.\r\n\r\nIn the delayed inode code we have an optimization that will free extra\r\nreservations if we think we can pack a dir item into an already modified\r\nleaf.  Previously this wouldn't be triggered in the subvolume create\r\ncase because we'd commit the transaction, it was still possible but\r\nmuch harder to trigger.  It could actually be triggered if we did a\r\nmkdir  subvol create with qgroups enabled.\r\n\r\nThis occurs because in btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index(), which gets\r\ncalled when we're adding the dir item, we do the following\r\n\r\n  btrfs_block_rsv_release(fs_info, trans->block_rsv, bytes, NULL)\r\n\r\nif we're able to skip reserving space.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that trans->block_rsv points at the temporary block\r\nrsv for the subvolume create, which has qgroup reservations in the block\r\nrsv.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem because btrfs_block_rsv_release() will do the\r\nfollowing\r\n\r\n  if (block_rsv->qgroup_rsv_reserved >= block_rsv->qgroup_rsv_size) {\r\n\t  qgroup_to_release = block_rsv->qgroup_rsv_reserved -\r\n\t\t  block_rsv->qgroup_rsv_size\r\n\t  block_rsv->qgroup_rsv_reserved = block_rsv->qgroup_rsv_size\r\n  }\r\n\r\nThe temporary block rsv just has ->qgroup_rsv_reserved set,\r\n->qgroup_rsv_size == 0.  The optimization in\r\nbtrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index() sets ->qgroup_rsv_reserved = 0.  Then\r\nlater on when we call btrfs_subvolume_release_metadata() which has\r\n\r\n  btrfs_block_rsv_release(fs_info, rsv, (u64)-1, qgroup_to_release)\r\n  btrfs_qgroup_convert_reserved_meta(root, qgroup_to_release)\r\n\r\nqgroup_to_release is set to 0, and we do not convert the reserved\r\nmetadata space.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the block rsv code has been unconditionally\r\nmessing with ->qgroup_rsv_reserved, because the main place this is used\r\nis delalloc, and any time we call btrfs_block_rsv_release() we do it\r\nwith qgroup_to_release set, and thus do the proper accounting.\r\n\r\nThe subvolume code is the only other code that uses the qgroup\r\nreservation stuff, but it's intermingled with the above optimization,\r\nand thus was getting its reservation freed out from underneath it and\r\nthus leaking the reserved space.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to simply not mess with the qgroup reservations if we\r\ndon't have qgroup_to_release set.  This works with the existing code as\r\nanything that messes with the delalloc reservations always have\r\nqgroup_to_release set.  This fixes the leak that Boris was observing. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54158</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-54158</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-54159 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nusb mtu3 fix kernel panic at ...</title>\r\n      <description>[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nusb mtu3 fix kernel panic at qmu transfer done irq handler\r\n\r\nWhen handle qmu transfer irq, it will unlock @mtu->lock before give back\r\nrequest, if another thread handle disconnect event at the same time, and\r\ntry to disable ep, it may lock @mtu->lock and free qmu ring, then qmu\r\nirq hanlder may get a NULL gpd, avoid the KE by checking gpd's value before\r\nhandling it.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\nqmu done irq on cpu0                 thread running on cpu1\r\n\r\nqmu_done_tx()\r\n  handle gpd [0]\r\n    mtu3_requ_complete()        mtu3_gadget_ep_disable()\r\n      unlock @mtu->lock\r\n        give back request         lock @mtu->lock\r\n                                    mtu3_ep_disable()\r\n                                      mtu3_gpd_ring_free()\r\n                                   unlock @mtu->lock\r\n      lock @mtu->lock\r\n    get next gpd [1]\r\n\r\n[1] goto [0] to handle next gpd, and next gpd may be NULL. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54159</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-54159</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-54160 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nfirmware arm_sdei Fix sleep f...</title>\r\n      <description>[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nfirmware arm_sdei Fix sleep from invalid context BUG\r\n\r\nRunning a preempt-rt (v6.2-rc3-rt1) based kernel on an Ampere Altra\r\ntriggers\r\n\r\n  BUG sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c46\r\n  in_atomic() 0, irqs_disabled() 128, non_block 0, pid 24, name cpuhp/0\r\n  preempt_count 0, expected 0\r\n  RCU nest depth 0, expected 0\r\n  3 locks held by cpuhp/0/24\r\n    #0 ffffda30217c70d0 (cpu_hotplug_lock){++++}-{00}, at cpuhp_thread_fun+0x5c/0x248\r\n    #1 ffffda30217c7120 (cpuhp_state-up){+.+.}-{00}, at cpuhp_thread_fun+0x5c/0x248\r\n    #2 ffffda3021c711f0 (sdei_list_lock){....}-{33}, at sdei_cpuhp_up+0x3c/0x130\r\n  irq event stamp 36\r\n  hardirqs last  enabled at (35) [ffffda301e85b7bc>] finish_task_switch+0xb4/0x2b0\r\n  hardirqs last disabled at (36) [ffffda301e812fec>] cpuhp_thread_fun+0x21c/0x248\r\n  softirqs last  enabled at (0) [ffffda301e80b184>] copy_process+0x63c/0x1ac0\r\n  softirqs last disabled at (0) [0000000000000000>] 0x0\r\n  CPU 0 PID 24 Comm cpuhp/0 Not tainted 5.19.0-rc3-rt5-[...]\r\n  Hardware name WIWYNN Mt.Jade Server [...]\r\n  Call trace\r\n    dump_backtrace+0x114/0x120\r\n    show_stack+0x20/0x70\r\n    dump_stack_lvl+0x9c/0xd8\r\n    dump_stack+0x18/0x34\r\n    __might_resched+0x188/0x228\r\n    rt_spin_lock+0x70/0x120\r\n    sdei_cpuhp_up+0x3c/0x130\r\n    cpuhp_invoke_callback+0x250/0xf08\r\n    cpuhp_thread_fun+0x120/0x248\r\n    smpboot_thread_fn+0x280/0x320\r\n    kthread+0x130/0x140\r\n    ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20\r\n\r\nsdei_cpuhp_up() is called in the STARTING hotplug section,\r\nwhich runs with interrupts disabled.

If we close both\r\nsockets without receiving FD, the sockets will be cleaned up by garbage\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nThe garbage collection iterates such sockets and unlinks skb with\r\nFD from the socket's receive queue under the queue's lock.\r\n\r\nSo, there is a race where unix_stream_sendpage() could access an skb\r\nlocklessly that is being released by garbage collection, resulting in\r\nuse-after-free.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the issue, unix_stream_sendpage() must lock the peer's recv\r\nqueue.\r\n\r\nNote the issue does not exist in 6.5+ thanks to the recent sendpage()\r\nrefactoring.\r\n\r\nThis patch is originally written by Linus Torvalds.\r\n\r\nBUG unable to handle page fault for address ffff988004dd6870\r\nPF supervisor read access in kernel

This could lead to\r\ninconsistent access results, potential access right widening, and\r\nhard-to-debug renames, especially since such paths cannot be printed.\r\n\r\nFor a sandboxed task to create a disconnected directory, it needs to\r\nhave write access (i.e. FS_MAKE_REG, FS_REMOVE_FILE, and FS_REFER) to\r\nthe underlying source of the bind mount, and read access to the related\r\nmount point.   Because a sandboxed task cannot acquire more access\r\nrights than those defined by its Landlock domain, this could lead to\r\ninconsistent access rights due to missing permissions that should be\r\ninherited from the mount point hierarchy, while inheriting permissions\r\nfrom the filesystem hierarchy hidden by this mount point instead.\r\n\r\nLandlock now handles files and directories opened from disconnected\r\ndirectories by taking into account the filesystem hierarchy when the\r\nmount point is not found in the hierarchy walk, and also always taking\r\ninto account the mount point from which these disconnected directories\r\nwere opened.  This ensures that a rename is not allowed if it would\r\nwiden access rights [1].\r\n\r\nThe rationale is that, even if disconnected hierarchies might not be\r\nvisible or accessible to a sandboxed task, relying on the collected\r\naccess rights from them improves the guarantee that access rights will\r\nnot be widened during a rename because of the access right comparison\r\nbetween the source and the destination (see LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER).\r\nIt may look like this would grant more access on disconnected files and\r\ndirectories, but the security policies are always enforced for all the\r\nevaluated hierarchies.  This new behavior should be less surprising to\r\nusers and safer from an access control perspective.\r\n\r\nRemove a wrong WARN_ON_ONCE() canary in collect_domain_accesses() and\r\nfix the related comment.\r\n\r\nBecause opened files have their access rights stored in the related file\r\nsecurity properties, there is no impact for disconnected or unlinked\r\nfiles. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:16:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68736</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-68736</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2025-68737 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\narm64/pageattr Propagate retur...</title>\r\n      <description>[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\narm64/pageattr Propagate return value from __change_memory_common\r\n\r\nThe rodata=on security measure requires that any code path which does\r\nvmalloc -> set_memory_ro/set_memory_rox must protect the linear map alias\r\ntoo.

X2APIC mode is mostly compatible with legacy APIC, but\r\nit disables the memory-mapped APIC interface in favor of one that uses\r\nMSRs.  The APIC mode is controlled by the EXT bit in the APIC MSR.\r\n\r\nThe MMIO/xAPIC interface has some problems, most notably the APIC LEAK\r\n[1].  This bug allows an attacker to use the APIC MMIO interface to\r\nextract data from the SGX enclave.\r\n\r\nIntroduce support for a new feature that will allow the BIOS to lock\r\nthe APIC in x2APIC mode.  If the APIC is locked in x2APIC mode and the\r\nkernel tries to disable the APIC or revert to legacy APIC mode a GP\r\nfault will occur.\r\n\r\nIntroduce support for a new MSR (IA32_XAPIC_DISABLE_STATUS) and handle\r\nthe new locked mode when the LEGACY_XAPIC_DISABLED bit is set by\r\npreventing the kernel from trying to disable the x2APIC.\r\n\r\nOn platforms with the IA32_XAPIC_DISABLE_STATUS MSR, if SGX or TDX are\r\nenabled the LEGACY_XAPIC_DISABLED will be set by the BIOS.  If\r\nlegacy APIC is required, then it SGX and TDX need to be disabled in the\r\nBIOS.\r\n\r\n[1] https//aepicleak.com/aepicleak.pdf | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:15:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50720</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2022-50720</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2022-50721 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\ndmaengine qcom-adm fix wrong ...</title>\r\n      <description>[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\ndmaengine qcom-adm fix wrong calling convention for prep_slave_sg\r\n\r\nThe calling convention for pre_slave_sg is to return NULL on error and\r\nprovide an error log to the system.

This is happening on copy engine\r\nchannel 3 (CE3) where the driver normally enqueues WMI commands to the\r\nfirmware. Upon receiving a copy complete interrupt, host driver will\r\nimmediately unmap and frees the buffer presuming that hardware has\r\nprocessed the buffer. In the issue case, upon receiving copy complete\r\ninterrupt, host driver will unmap and free the buffer but since hardware\r\nis still accessing the buffer (which in this case got unmapped in\r\nparallel), SMMU hardware will trigger an SMMU fault resulting in a\r\nkernel panic.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid this, as a work around, add a delay before unmapping\r\nthe copy engine source DMA buffer.

Since that commit\r\nit sends a C2H message when the TX rate changes.)\r\n\r\nTo fix this, delete the check for rf_paths > 1 and the goto. Let the\r\nfunction process the C2H messages from RTL8192EU like the ones from\r\nthe other chips.\r\n\r\nTheoretically the RTL8188FU could also leak like RTL8723BU, but it\r\nmost likely doesn't send C2H messages frequently enough.\r\n\r\nThis change was tested with RTL8723BU by Erhard F. I tested it with\r\nRTL8188FU and RTL8192EU. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:15:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54036</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-54036</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-54037 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nice prevent NULL pointer deref...</title>\r\n      <description>[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nice prevent NULL pointer deref during reload\r\n\r\nCalling ethtool during reload can lead to call trace, because VSI isn't\r\nconfigured for some time, but netdev is alive.\r\n\r\nTo fix it add rtnl lock for VSI deconfig and config.

Do not attempt to use bitfields to synchronize parallel\r\n     algorithms.\r\n\r\n (*) Even in cases where bitfields are protected by locks, all fields\r\n     in a given bitfield must be protected by one lock.  If two fields\r\n     in a given bitfield are protected by different locks, the compiler's\r\n     non-atomic read-modify-write sequences can cause an update to one\r\n     field to corrupt the value of an adjacent field.\r\n\r\nbtrfs_space_info has a bitfield sharing an underlying word consisting of\r\nthe fields full, chunk_alloc, and flush\r\n\r\nstruct btrfs_space_info {\r\n        struct btrfs_fs_info *     fs_info              /*     0     8 */\r\n        struct btrfs_space_info *  parent               /*     8     8 */\r\n        ...\r\n        int                        clamp                /*   172     4 */\r\n        unsigned int               full1               /*   176 0  4 */\r\n        unsigned int               chunk_alloc1        /*   176 1  4 */\r\n        unsigned int               flush1              /*   176 2  4 */\r\n        ...\r\n\r\nTherefore, to be safe from parallel read-modify-writes losing a write to\r\none of the bitfield members protected by a lock, all writes to all the\r\nbitfields must use the lock. They almost universally do, except for\r\nbtrfs_clear_space_info_full() which iterates over the space_infos and\r\nwrites out found->full = 0 without a lock.\r\n\r\nImagine that we have one thread completing a transaction in which we\r\nfinished deleting a block_group and are thus calling\r\nbtrfs_clear_space_info_full() while simultaneously the data reclaim\r\nticket infrastructure is running do_async_reclaim_data_space()\r\n\r\n          T1                                             T2\r\nbtrfs_commit_transaction\r\n  btrfs_clear_space_info_full\r\n  data_sinfo->full = 0\r\n  READ full0, chunk_alloc0, flush1\r\n                                              do_async_reclaim_data_space(data_sinfo)\r\n                                              spin_lock(space_info->lock)\r\n                                              if(list_empty(tickets))\r\n                                                space_info->flush = 0\r\n                                                READ full 0, chunk_alloc0, flush1\r\n                                                MOD/WRITE full 0, chunk_alloc0, flush0\r\n                                                spin_unlock(space_info->lock)\r\n                                                return\r\n  MOD/WRITE full0, chunk_alloc0, flush1\r\n\r\nand now data_sinfo->flush is 1 but the reclaim worker has exited. This\r\nbreaks the invariant that flush is 0 iff there is no work queued or\r\nrunning. Once this invariant is violated, future allocations that go\r\ninto __reserve_bytes() will add tickets to space_info->tickets but will\r\nsee space_info->flush is set to 1 and not queue the work. After this,\r\nthey will block forever on the resulting ticket, as it is now impossible\r\nto kick the worker again.\r\n\r\nI also confirmed by looking at the assembly of the affected kernel that\r\nit is doing RMW operations. For example, to set the flush (3rd) bit to 0,\r\nthe assembly is\r\n  andb    $0xfb,0x60(%rbx)\r\nand similarly for setting the full (1st) bit to 0\r\n  andb    $0xfe,-0x20(%rax)\r\n\r\nSo I think this is really a bug on practical systems.  I have observed\r\na number of systems in this exact state, but am currently unable to\r\nreproduce it.\r\n\r\nRather than leaving this footgun lying around for the future, take\r\nadvantage of the fact that there is room in the struct anyway, and that\r\nit is already quite large and simply change the three bitfield members to\r\nbools.

This could happen if the\r\nrecord was reported to already exist in the\r\nbtrfs_qgroup_trace_extent_nolock() call, but then there was an error\r\nlater on add_delayed_ref_head(). In this case, since\r\nadd_delayed_ref_head() returned an error, the caller went to free the\r\nrecord. Since add_delayed_ref_head() couldn't set this kfree'd pointer\r\nto NULL, then kfree() would have acted on a non-NULL 'record' object\r\nwhich was pointing to memory already freed by the callee.\r\n\r\nThe problem comes from the fact that the responsibility to kfree the\r\nobject is on both the caller and the callee at the same time. Hence, the\r\nfix for this is to shift the ownership of the 'qrecord' object out of\r\nthe add_delayed_ref_head(). That is, we will never attempt to kfree()\r\nthe given object inside of this function, and will expect the caller to\r\nact on the 'qrecord' object on its own. The only exception where the\r\n'qrecord' object cannot be kfree'd is if it was inserted into the\r\ntracing logic, for which we already have the 'qrecord_inserted_ret'\r\nboolean to account for this. Hence, the caller has to kfree the object\r\nonly if add_delayed_ref_head() reports not to have inserted it on the\r\ntracing logic.\r\n\r\nAs a side-effect of the above, we must guarantee that\r\n'qrecord_inserted_ret' is properly initialized at the start of the\r\nfunction, not at the end, and then set when an actual insert\r\nhappens. This way we avoid 'qrecord_inserted_ret' having an invalid\r\nvalue on an early exit.\r\n\r\nThe documentation from the add_delayed_ref_head() has also been updated\r\nto reflect on the exact ownership of the 'qrecord' object. | Severity UNKNOWN</description>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:15:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68359</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2025-68359</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2025-68360 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nwifi mt76 wed use proper wed...</title>\r\n      <description>[[[[[[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nwifi mt76 wed use proper wed reference in mt76 wed driver callabacks\r\n\r\nMT7996 driver can use both wed and wed_hif2 devices to offload traffic\r\nfrom/to the wireless NIC.
