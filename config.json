This is due to the plugin not properly logging in a user with the data that was previously verified through the 'eltdf_membership_check_facebook_user' and the 'eltdf_membership_login_user_from_social_network' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as administrative users, as long as they have an existing account on the site which can easily be created by default through the temp user functionality, and access to the administrative user's email. | CVSS Score 9.8 (CRITICAL)  </description>\n      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 03:15:00 GMT</pubDate>\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13613</link>\n      <guid>CVE-2025-13613</guid>\n    </item>\n  \n    <item>\n      <title>ARN (Stockholm) on 2025-12-12</title>\n      <description>![CDATA[strong>THIS IS A SCHEDULED EVENT Dec var data-var='date'>12/var>, var data-var='time'>0100/var> - var data-var='time'>0500/var> UTC/strong>small>Dec var data-var='date'>10/var>, var data-var='time'>0402/var> UTC/small>strong>Scheduled/strong> - We will be performing scheduled maintenance in ARN (Stockholm) datacenter on 2025-12-12 between 0100 and 0500 UTC.br />br />Traffic might be re-routed from this location, hence there is a possibility of a slight increase in latency during this maintenance window for end-users in the affected region.

Versions 1.6.0 through 1.8.0  inadvertently forward all traffic with the same destination port as the host port when the portmap plugin is configured with the nftables backend, thus ignoring the destination IP. This includes traffic not intended for the node itself, i.e. traffic to containers hosted on the node. Containers that request HostPort forwarding can intercept all traffic destined for that port. This requires that the portmap plugin be explicitly configured to use the nftables backend. This issue is fixed in version 1.9.0.

Versions 0.5.5 and below are vulnerable to arbitrary remote code execution on the development server through unsafe dynamic imports in server function APIs (loadServerAction, decodeReply, decodeAction) when integrated into RSC applications that expose server function endpoints. Attackers with network access to the development server can read/modify files, exfiltrate sensitive data (source code, environment variables, credentials), or pivot to other internal services. While this affects development servers only, the risk increases when using vite --host to expose the server on all network interfaces.

It shows that we miss freeing struct seccomp_filter\r\nand some objects included in it.\r\n\r\nWe can reproduce the issue with the program below [2] which calls one\r\nseccomp() and two clone() syscalls.\r\n\r\nThe first clone()d child exits earlier than its parent and sends a\r\nsignal to kill it during the second clone(), more precisely before the\r\nfatal_signal_pending() test in copy_process().  When the parent receives\r\nthe signal, it has to destroy the embryonic process and return -EINTR to\r\nuser space.  In the failure path, we have to call seccomp_filter_release()\r\nto decrement the filter's refcount.\r\n\r\nInitially, we called it in free_task() called from the failure path, but\r\nthe commit 3a15fb6ed92c (\"seccomp release filter after task is fully\r\ndead\") moved it to release_task() to notify user space as early as possible\r\nthat the filter is no longer used.\r\n\r\nTo keep the change and current seccomp refcount semantics, let's move\r\ncopy_seccomp() just after the signal check and add a WARN_ON_ONCE() in\r\nfree_task() for future debugging.\r\n\r\n[0]\r\nunreferenced object 0xffff8880063add00 (size 256)\r\n  comm \"repro_seccomp\", pid 230, jiffies 4294687090 (age 9.914s)\r\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes)\r\n    01 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\r\n    ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff  ................\r\n  backtrace\r\n    do_seccomp (./include/linux/slab.h600 ./include/linux/slab.h733 kernel/seccomp.c666 kernel/seccomp.c708 kernel/seccomp.c1871 kernel/seccomp.c1991)\r\n    do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c50 arch/x86/entry/common.c80)\r\n    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S120)\r\nunreferenced object 0xffffc90000035000 (size 4096)\r\n  comm \"repro_seccomp\", pid 230, jiffies 4294687090 (age 9.915s)\r\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes)\r\n    01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 05 00 00 00  ................\r\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\r\n  backtrace\r\n    __vmalloc_node_range (mm/vmalloc.c3226)\r\n    __vmalloc_node (mm/vmalloc.c3261 (discriminator 4))\r\n    bpf_prog_alloc_no_stats (kernel/bpf/core.c91)\r\n    bpf_prog_alloc (kernel/bpf/core.c129)\r\n    bpf_prog_create_from_user (net/core/filter.c1414)\r\n    do_seccomp (kernel/seccomp.c671 kernel/seccomp.c708 kernel/seccomp.c1871 kernel/seccomp.c1991)\r\n    do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c50 arch/x86/entry/common.c80)\r\n    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S120)\r\nunreferenced object 0xffff888003fa1000 (size 1024)\r\n  comm \"repro_seccomp\", pid 230, jiffies 4294687090 (age 9.915s)\r\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes)\r\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\r\n    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................\r\n  backtrace\r\n    bpf_prog_alloc_no_stats (./include/linux/slab.h600 ./include/linux/slab.h733 kernel/bpf/core.c95)\r\n    bpf_prog_alloc (kernel/bpf/core.c129)\r\n    bpf_prog_create_from_user (net/core/filter.c1414)\r\n    do_seccomp (kernel/seccomp.c671 kernel/seccomp.c708 kernel/seccomp.c1871 kernel/seccomp.c1991)\r\n    do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c50 arch/x86/entry/common.c80)\r\n    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S120)\r\nunreferenced object 0xffff888006360240 (size 16)\r\n  comm \"repro_seccomp\", pid 230, jiffies 4294687090 (age 9.915s)\r\n  hex dump (first 16 bytes)\r\n    01 00 37 00 76 65 72 6c e0 83 01 06 80 88 ff ff  ..7.verl........\r\n  backtrace\r\n    bpf_prog_store_orig_filter (net/core/filter.c1137)\r\n    bpf_prog_create_from_user (net/core/filter.c1428)\r\n    do_seccomp (kernel/seccomp.c671 kernel/seccomp.c708 kernel/seccomp.c1871 kernel/seccomp.c1991)\r\n    do_syscall_64 (arch/x86/entry/common.c50 arch/x86/entry/common.c80)\r\n    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe (arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S120)\r\nunreferenced object 0xffff888\r\n---truncated--- | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50661</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2022-50661</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2022-50662 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nRDMA/hns fix memory leak in hn...</title>\r\n      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nRDMA/hns fix memory leak in hns_roce_alloc_mr()\r\n\r\nWhen hns_roce_mr_enable() failed in hns_roce_alloc_mr(), mr_key is not\r\nreleased.

Therefore mte_sync_tags() could safely use\r\ntest_and_set_bit(PG_mte_tagged, page->flags) without inadvertently\r\nsetting PG_mte_tagged on an untagged page.\r\n\r\nThe above commit was required as guests may enable MTE without any\r\ncontrol at the stage 2 mapping, nor a PROT_MTE mapping in the VMM.\r\nHowever, the side-effect was that any page with a PTE that looked like\r\nswap (or migration) was getting PG_mte_tagged set automatically. A\r\nsubsequent page copy (e.g. migration) copied the tags to the destination\r\npage even if the tags were owned by KASAN.\r\n\r\nThis issue was masked by the page_kasan_tag_reset() call introduced in\r\ncommit e5b8d9218951 (\"arm64 mte reset the page tag in page->flags\").\r\nWhen this commit was reverted (20794545c146), KASAN started reporting\r\naccess faults because the overriding tags in a

re-queued this work while __flush_work()\r\n from cancel_delayed_work_sync() was waiting for this work to complete,\r\nretried rds_{send,recv}_worker() is no-op due to the absence of RDS_CONN_UP\r\nbit. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n

the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\niio adc ina2xx avoid NULL pointer dereference on OF device match\r\n\r\nThe affected lines were resulting in a NULL pointer dereference on our\r\nplatform because the device tree contained the following list of\r\ncompatible strings\r\n\r\n    power-sensor@40 {\r\n        compatible = \"ti,ina232\", \"ti,ina231\"\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSince the driver doesn't declare a compatible string \"ti,ina232\", the OF\r\nmatching succeeds on \"ti,ina231\". But the I2C device ID info is\r\npopulated via the first compatible string, cf. modalias population in\r\nof_i2c_get_board_info(). Since there is no \"ina232\" entry in the legacy\r\nI2C device ID table either, the struct i2c_device_id *id pointer in the\r\nprobe function is NULL.\r\n\r\nFix this by using the already populated type variable instead, which\r\npoints to the proper driver data. Since the name is also wanted, add a\r\ngeneric one to the ina2xx_config table. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53834</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53834</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-53835 Rejected reason This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority.</title>\r\n      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[Rejected reason This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  ]]>  </description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53835</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53835</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-53836 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nbpf, sockmap Fix skb refcnt ra...</title>\r\n      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nbpf, sockmap Fix skb refcnt race after locking changes\r\n\r\nThere is a race where skb's from the sk_psock_backlog can be referenced\r\nafter userspace side has already skb_consumed() the sk_buff and its refcnt\r\ndropped to zer0 causing use after free.\r\n\r\nThe flow is the following\r\n\r\n  while ((skb = skb_peek(psock->ingress_skb))\r\n    sk_psock_handle_Skb(psock, skb, ..., ingress)\r\n    if (!ingress) ...\r\n    sk_psock_skb_ingress\r\n       sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue(skb)\r\n          msg->skb = skb\r\n          sk_psock_queue_msg(psock, msg)\r\n    skb_dequeue(psock->ingress_skb)\r\n\r\nThe sk_psock_queue_msg() puts the msg on the ingress_msg queue. This is\r\nwhat the application reads when recvmsg() is called. An application can\r\nread this anytime after the msg is placed on the queue. The recvmsg hook\r\nwill also read msg->skb and then after user space reads the msg will call\r\nconsume_skb(skb) on it effectively free'ing it.\r\n\r\nBut, the race is in above where backlog queue still has a reference to\r\nthe skb and calls skb_dequeue(). If the skb_dequeue happens after the\r\nuser reads and free's the skb we have a use after free.\r\n\r\nThe !ingress case does not suffer from this problem because it uses\r\nsendmsg_*(sk, msg) which does not pass the sk_buff further down the\r\nstack.\r\n\r\nThe following splat was observed with 'test_progs -t sockmap_listen'\r\n\r\n  [ 1022.710250][ T2556] general protection fault, ...\r\n  [...]\r\n  [ 1022.712830][ T2556] Workqueue events sk_psock_backlog\r\n  [ 1022.713262][ T2556] RIP 0010skb_dequeue+0x4c/0x80\r\n  [ 1022.713653][ T2556] Code ...\r\n  [...]\r\n  [ 1022.720699][ T2556] Call Trace\r\n  [ 1022.720984][ T2556]  TASK>\r\n  [ 1022.721254][ T2556]  ? die_addr+0x32/0x80^M\r\n  [ 1022.721589][ T2556]  ? exc_general_protection+0x25a/0x4b0\r\n  [ 1022.722026][ T2556]  ? asm_exc_general_protection+0x22/0x30\r\n  [ 1022.722489][ T2556]  ? skb_dequeue+0x4c/0x80\r\n  [ 1022.722854][ T2556]  sk_psock_backlog+0x27a/0x300\r\n  [ 1022.723243][ T2556]  process_one_work+0x2a7/0x5b0\r\n  [ 1022.723633][ T2556]  worker_thread+0x4f/0x3a0\r\n  [ 1022.723998][ T2556]  ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\r\n  [ 1022.724386][ T2556]  kthread+0xfd/0x130\r\n  [ 1022.724709][ T2556]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\r\n  [ 1022.725066][ T2556]  ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50\r\n  [ 1022.725409][ T2556]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\r\n  [ 1022.725799][ T2556]  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30\r\n  [ 1022.726201][ T2556]  /TASK>\r\n\r\nTo fix we add an skb_get() before passing the skb to be enqueued in the\r\nengress queue. This bumps the skb->users refcnt so that consume_skb()\r\nand kfree_skb will not immediately free the sk_buff. With this we can\r\nbe sure the skb is still around when we do the dequeue. Then we just\r\nneed to decrement the refcnt or free the skb in the backlog case which\r\nwe do by calling kfree_skb() on the ingress case as well as the sendmsg\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nBefore locking change from fixes tag we had the sock locked so we\r\ncouldn't race with user and there was no issue here. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53836</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53836</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-53837 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\ndrm/msm fix NULL-deref on snap...</title>\r\n      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\ndrm/msm fix NULL-deref on snapshot tear down\r\n\r\nIn case of early initialisation errors and on platforms that do not use\r\nthe DPU controller, the deinitilisation code can be called with the kms\r\npointer set to NULL.\r\n\r\nPatchwork https//patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/525099/ | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53837</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53837</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-53838 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nf2fs synchronize atomic write ...</title>\r\n      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nf2fs synchronize atomic write aborts\r\n\r\nTo fix a race condition between atomic write aborts, I use the inode\r\nlock and make COW inode to be re-usable thoroughout the whole\r\natomic file inode lifetime. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53838</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53838</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-53839 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\ndccp fix data-race around dp->...</title>\r\n      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\ndccp fix data-race around dp->dccps_mss_cache\r\n\r\ndccp_sendmsg() reads dp->dccps_mss_cache before locking the socket.\r\nSame thing in do_dccp_getsockopt().\r\n\r\nAdd READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() annotations,\r\nand change dccp_sendmsg() to check again dccps_mss_cache\r\nafter socket is locked. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53839</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53839</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-53840 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nusb early xhci-dbc Fix a pot...</title>\r\n      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\nusb early xhci-dbc Fix a potential out-of-bound memory access\r\n\r\nIf xdbc_bulk_write() fails, the values in 'buf' can be anything.

That means that if you have parts of your driver\r\nthat aren't using devm or are using \"roll your own\" devm w/\r\ndevm_add_action_or_reset() you need to keep that in mind.\r\n\r\nThe mt8186 audio driver didn't quite get this right. Specifically, in\r\nmt8186_init_clock() it called mt8186_audsys_clk_register() and then\r\nwent on to call a bunch of other devm function. The caller of\r\nmt8186_init_clock() used devm_add_action_or_reset() to call\r\nmt8186_deinit_clock() but, because of the intervening devm functions,\r\nthe order was wrong.\r\n\r\nSpecifically at probe time, the order was\r\n1. mt8186_audsys_clk_register()\r\n2. afe_priv->clk = devm_kcalloc(...)\r\n3. afe_priv->clk[i] = devm_clk_get(...)\r\n\r\nAt remove time, the order (which should have been 3, 2, 1) was\r\n1. mt8186_audsys_clk_unregister()\r\n3. Free all of afe_priv->clk[i]\r\n2. Free afe_priv->clk\r\n\r\nThe above seemed to be causing a use-after-free. Luckily, it's easy to\r\nfix this by simply using devm more correctly.

In particular for task local storage, it is easy to\r\nget a \"current\" task PTR_TO_BTF_ID in tracing bpf prog.\r\nHowever, task (and cgroup) local storage has already been moved to\r\nbpf mem allocator which can be used after raw_spin_lock.\r\n\r\nThe splat is for the sk storage. For sk (and inode) storage,\r\nit has not been moved to bpf mem allocator. Using raw_spin_lock or not,\r\nkzalloc(GFP_ATOMIC) could theoretically be unsafe in tracing context.\r\nHowever, the local storage helper requires a verifier accepted\r\nsk pointer (PTR_TO_BTF_ID), it is hypothetical if that (mean running\r\na bpf prog in a kzalloc unsafe context and also able to hold a verifier\r\naccepted sk pointer) could happen.\r\n\r\nThis patch avoids kzalloc after raw_spin_lock to silent the splat.\r\nThere is an existing kzalloc before the raw_spin_lock. At that point,\r\na kzalloc is very likely required because a lookup has just been done\r\nbefore. Thus, this patch always does the kzalloc before acq\r\n---truncated--- | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53857</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53857</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-53858 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\ntty serial samsung_tty Fix a...</title>\r\n      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\ntty serial samsung_tty Fix a memory leak in s3c24xx_serial_getclk() in case of error\r\n\r\nIf clk_get_rate() fails, the clk that has just been allocated needs to be\r\nfreed. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53858</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53858</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>CVE-2023-53859 In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\ns390/idle mark arch_cpu_idle()...</title>\r\n      <description>![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[![CDATA[In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved\r\n\r\ns390/idle mark arch_cpu_idle() noinstr\r\n\r\nlinux-next commit (\"cpuidle tracing Warn about !rcu_is_watching()\")\r\nadds a new warning which hits on s390's arch_cpu_idle() function\r\n\r\nRCU not on for arch_cpu_idle+0x0/0x28\r\nWARNING CPU 2 PID 0 at include/linux/trace_recursion.h162 arch_ftrace_ops_list_func+0x24c/0x258\r\nModules linked in\r\nCPU 2 PID 0 Comm swapper/2 Not tainted 6.2.0-rc6-next-20230202 #4\r\nHardware name IBM 8561 T01 703 (z/VM 7.3.0)\r\nKrnl PSW  0404d00180000000 00000000002b55c0 (arch_ftrace_ops_list_func+0x250/0x258)\r\n           R0 T1 IO0 EX0 Key0 M1 W0 P0 AS3 CC1 PM0 RI0 EA3\r\nKrnl GPRS c0000000ffffbfff 0000000080000002 0000000000000026 0000000000000000\r\n           0000037ffffe3a28 0000037ffffe3a20 0000000000000000 0000000000000000\r\n           0000000000000000 0000000000f4acf6 00000000001044f0 0000037ffffe3cb0\r\n           0000000000000000 0000000000000000 00000000002b55bc 0000037ffffe3bb8\r\nKrnl Code 00000000002b55b0 c02000840051        larl    %r2,0000000001335652\r\n           00000000002b55b6 c0e5fff512d1        brasl   %r14,0000000000157b58\r\n          #00000000002b55bc af000000            mc      0,0\r\n          >00000000002b55c0 a7f4ffe7            brc     15,00000000002b558e\r\n           00000000002b55c4 0707                bcr     0,%r7\r\n           00000000002b55c6 0707                bcr     0,%r7\r\n           00000000002b55c8 eb6ff0480024        stmg    %r6,%r15,72(%r15)\r\n           00000000002b55ce b90400ef            lgr     %r14,%r15\r\nCall Trace\r\n [00000000002b55c0>] arch_ftrace_ops_list_func+0x250/0x258\r\n([00000000002b55bc>] arch_ftrace_ops_list_func+0x24c/0x258)\r\n [0000000000f5f0fc>] ftrace_common+0x1c/0x20\r\n [00000000001044f6>] arch_cpu_idle+0x6/0x28\r\n [0000000000f4acf6>] default_idle_call+0x76/0x128\r\n [00000000001cc374>] do_idle+0xf4/0x1b0\r\n [00000000001cc6ce>] cpu_startup_entry+0x36/0x40\r\n [0000000000119d00>] smp_start_secondary+0x140/0x150\r\n [0000000000f5d2ae>] restart_int_handler+0x6e/0x90\r\n\r\nMark arch_cpu_idle() noinstr like all other architectures with\r\nCONFIG_ARCH_WANTS_NO_INSTR (should) have it to fix this. | Severity UNKNOWN  ]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]></description>\r\n      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:17:00 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <link>https//nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53859</link>\r\n      <guid>CVE-2023-53859</guid>\r\n    </item>\r\n  </channel>\r\n</rss>"
