# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a robust XML content cleaning function to sanitize text content before including it in XML feeds. The function will handle various types of problematic characters, HTML entities, and formatting issues that can break XML structure or cause parsing errors. This is essential for maintaining valid XML feeds and preventing content injection or malformed XML issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer generating XML feeds, I want to clean text content to ensure it's XML-safe, so that the generated XML remains valid and parseable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the function receives text with HTML entities THEN the system SHALL properly escape or convert them for XML compatibility
2. WHEN the function receives text with XML special characters (&, <, >, ", ') THEN the system SHALL escape them using proper XML entities
3. WHEN the function receives text with control characters THEN the system SHALL remove or replace them with safe alternatives
4. WHEN the function receives null or undefined input THEN the system SHALL return an empty string

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want line breaks and formatting to be handled consistently, so that the XML content displays properly across different systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the function receives text with Windows line endings (\r\n) THEN the system SHALL normalize them to Unix line endings (\n)
2. WHEN the function receives text with multiple consecutive whitespace characters THEN the system SHALL optionally normalize them to single spaces
3. WHEN the function receives text with HTML tags THEN the system SHALL either strip them or escape them based on configuration
4. WHEN the function receives text with leading/trailing whitespace THEN the system SHALL trim it

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the cleaning function to be configurable, so that I can adjust the cleaning behavior based on different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the function is called with configuration options THEN the system SHALL apply cleaning rules according to those options
2. WHEN no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use safe default cleaning rules
3. WHEN the function encounters unsupported characters THEN the system SHALL either remove them or replace them with safe alternatives
4. IF the input text is extremely long THEN the system SHALL handle it efficiently without performance degradation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the function to handle edge cases gracefully, so that the application doesn't crash when processing unexpected content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the function receives an empty string THEN the system SHALL return an empty string
2. WHEN the function receives text with only whitespace THEN the system SHALL return an empty string after trimming
3. WHEN the function receives text with mixed encoding issues THEN the system SHALL attempt to normalize the encoding
4. WHEN the function encounters circular references or complex objects THEN the system SHALL convert them to string representation safely
